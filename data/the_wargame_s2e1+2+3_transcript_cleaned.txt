THE WARGAME - CLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT
============================================================


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[51.09–52.61] Dr Rob Johnson: So my name is Dr Rob Johnson.

[54.24–59.05] Dr Rob Johnson: My area of research is about decision-making in crises and in conflicts.

[63.53–67.94] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob Johnson is showing me a piece of his own family's wartime history.

[68.5–70.58] Dr Rob Johnson: It's something he always keeps with him.

[71.92–78.35] Dr Rob Johnson: In front of me, I've got my grandfather's pocket watch, which he carried during the Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the Mediterranean at Malta.

[79.11–82.66] Dr Rob Johnson: And this pocket watch was given to my father and subsequently to me.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[86.08–91.85] Dr Rob Johnson: Reginald Johnson had been a Shakespearean actor before the Second World War broke out.

[93.06–100.64] Dr Rob Johnson: Like most of his generation, he put his own dreams on hold to serve the nation in its time of crisis.

[101.96–109.86] Dr Rob Johnson: His grandson, though, has dedicated his whole life to defence as a soldier, a scholar and a senior civil servant.

[111.29–129.61] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob is fiercely loyal to his country and would never want to talk it down, but he's become increasingly worried about the state of the UK's defences after a prolonged period of peace that's seen the government and society forget what it means to be ready for war.

[131.25–135.24] Dr Rob Johnson: It's a concern he raised while seconded to the Ministry of Defence.

[136.63–142.44] Dr Rob Johnson: My job was to try to alert colleagues to what was going on and where the gaps were.

[142.99–146.15] Dr Rob Johnson: What I found, actually, was that many, many people agreed with me.

[146.51–147.99] Dr Rob Johnson: They knew we were in the position we are.

[148.47–161.04] Dr Rob Johnson: But the response often was, look, government's about choice, and the government of the day and the governments we've had have all made the same choice, which is that we're going to invest in health and education and roads and growth, not in defence.

[163.36–174.86] Dr Rob Johnson: Resilience was second nature during the Cold War, but when the Soviet Union collapsed, successive prime ministers spent less on the armed forces and more on other priorities.

[175.88–186.47] Dr Rob Johnson: European allies did the same, all seeing this as a peace dividend, while gambling that the United States would still protect them if things went wrong.

[190.53–194.0] Dr Rob Johnson: But the threat posed by Russia never really went away.

[194.02–201.83] Dr Rob Johnson: And now, under Donald Trump, America's support to its partners in NATO no longer feels so guaranteed.

[201.85–204.55] Prime Minister: I think it's common sense, right?

[205.11–206.9] Prime Minister: If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them.

[206.94–208.12] Prime Minister: No, I'm not going to defend them.

[209.94–212.24] Prime Minister: I got into a lot of heat when I said that.

[212.28–214.47] Prime Minister: You said, oh, he's violating NATO.

[217.4–222.75] Dr Rob Johnson: With Europe weak and Russia on a war footing, it's a perfect storm.

[227.12–230.88] Dr Rob Johnson: I'm Debra Haines, the security and defence editor at Sky News.

[231.74–239.24] Dr Rob Johnson: I've been a journalist for the past two and a half decades and can tell you that Rob isn't alone with his concerns.

[242.07–253.88] Dr Rob Johnson: Pretty much everyone I speak to inside the military says the UK has allowed its defences to shrink too far and has lost the kind of national resilience it once had during the Cold War.

[254.65–263.64] Dr Rob Johnson: But because we live in a country that generally feels pretty safe, it's perhaps hard to understand why or even whether that matters.

[265.75–271.92] Dr Rob Johnson: It made me wonder, what if we simulate an emergency and find out how the UK might respond?

[272.98–277.96] Dr Rob Johnson: Whatever the outcome, it would at least bring to life the reality of the threat.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[279.59–289.42] Dr Rob Johnson: Last year I got in touch with Rob, who's out of government service now and back in his day job as the head of the changing character of War Centre at Oxford University.

[290.48–300.74] Dr Rob Johnson: I asked him if he might be up for running a war game about an attack on the UK, with former ministers and military chiefs playing the part of the British side.

[302.02–303.42] Dr Rob Johnson: He thought it was worth a try.

[303.46–306.81] Dr Rob Johnson: It's why we're sitting together in this basement.

[307.93–310.35] Dr Rob Johnson: So we chose a bunker, we've created some maps.

[311.79–315.9] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob's just finalising the game he's devised over the past few months.

[316.12–318.86] Dr Rob Johnson: So we've got a lot of mechanics we've had to put together behind the game.

[318.9–319.66] Dr Rob Johnson: It's taken a long time.

[320.28–321.44] Dr Rob Johnson: So I did a bit of research.

[321.46–326.61] Dr Rob Johnson: He describes the scenario as extremely low likelihood, but high impact.

[327.37–332.36] Dr Rob Johnson: That means a low chance of it happening, but catastrophic consequences if it did.

[335.0–339.95] Dr Rob Johnson: And as he works, on a desk in front of him is his grandfather's watch.

[340.82–348.15] Dr Rob Johnson: It's pretty dramatic because you can hear the ticking of this clock and it feels like, both in the game but also for real, that our time is running out.

[352.99–359.56] Dr Rob Johnson: What you're about to hear is the kind of war game that's genuinely tested inside government.

[361.12–366.17] Dr Rob Johnson: The main difference is that nothing discussed in Rob's version is classified.

[367.23–368.81] Dr Rob Johnson: Russia knows our weaknesses.

[369.85–370.59] Dr Rob Johnson: But do you?

[374.25–378.43] Dr Rob Johnson: From Sky News and Tortoise, this is The War Game.

[378.47–382.45] Dr Rob Johnson: Episode 1, False Flag.

[400.78–419.61] Dr Rob Johnson: First of all, thank you very much indeed all of you for the hours you're giving out, the time.

[419.64–422.19] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob is welcoming his players into the basement.

[423.13–430.04] Dr Rob Johnson: It's been transformed into the set of the War Game, with three rooms connected by a winding corridor.

[431.16–437.64] Dr Rob Johnson: Each one has a table, some chairs and a network of microphones to record every conversation.

[437.68–438.69] Dr Rob Johnson: Thank you as well.

[438.7–441.73] Dr Rob Johnson: I've got my Pembroke College students at the back from Oxford.

[442.25–443.01] Dr Rob Johnson: Thanks so much for coming.

[443.03–444.47] Dr Rob Johnson: They helped with all the rehearsals.

[444.57–450.24] Dr Rob Johnson: As the Games Master, he heads what's known as the White Cell, which runs the event.

[451.0–452.88] Dr Rob Johnson: A lovely crew of individuals at the back here.

[453.06–462.67] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob has a team of helpers who'll give the various participants certain slips of paper containing new information at different times throughout the game.

[462.74–467.14] Dr Rob Johnson: These, in Wargame language, are known as Injects.

[468.5–470.2] Dr Rob Johnson: Now let me bring in the players.

[471.23–486.47] Unknown: War games typically have a blue team and a red team.

[487.35–493.98] Dr Rob Johnson: In our scenario, blue is an imagined British government, while red is a fictional Kremlin.

[495.06–510.24] Dr Rob Johnson: We chose our cast carefully, ensuring a mix of Labour and Conservative ministers and top officials who either played the roles they've been given for real or have deep expertise in different but relevant jobs.

[511.9–518.39] Unknown: I'm Ben Wallis, former Secretary of State to Feds, and I'm going to be playing the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

[518.41–519.97] Dr Rob Johnson: Why did you want to take part in this?

[520.24–526.93] Unknown: Because I think it's really important that we demonstrate to the public how government makes decisions in real crisis and emergencies.

[527.77–537.58] Unknown: And it's at that moment in time that no matter what people's party politics are, people pull together for the right reasons.

[537.6–545.65] Dr Rob Johnson: In the war game, Ben heads a cross-party government at a time of heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin's Russia.

[546.6–550.47] Unknown: I think what's amazing about this, the team you put together, Debs, is we're all the real deal.

[550.54–556.96] Unknown: I mean, I'm not the prime minister, but we've all been there and I think that's quite unique, to be honest.

[560.85–563.88] Dr Rob Johnson: I'll let him and his team introduce themselves.

[565.02–569.19] Unknown: After myself as Prime Minister, which is an interesting choice, I'm going to look forward to it.

[569.75–571.13] Unknown: I've got Jack Straw.

[571.41–583.26] Jack Straw: Jack Straw, Home Secretary between 1997 and 2001, Foreign Secretary between 2001 and 2006, and Justice Secretary between 2007 and 2010.

[583.9–586.93] Jack Straw: He's very experienced.

[586.95–588.99] Jack Straw: And I'm playing the role of Foreign Secretary.

[589.59–593.26] Unknown: I've got Amber Rudd, my former boss when I was security minister in the Home Office.

[593.82–600.29] Unknown: Amber Rudd, former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change 2015-16 and then Home Secretary 2016-18.

[602.47–605.68] Unknown: She is going to be doing the part of the Home Secretary.

[606.04–608.88] Unknown: And then I've got my former colleague James Heape.

[608.86–614.23] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): James Heapie, I was Minister for the Armed Forces from 2019 to 2024 and I'm playing the Defence Secretary.

[614.85–623.82] Unknown: He's one of the most experienced parliamentarians who had done tours in Northern Ireland, in Iraq and Afghanistan as a soldier in some very difficult times.

[624.5–627.12] Unknown: I've got Baroness Kennedy as our Attorney General.

[627.57–632.71] Helena Kennedy: Helena Kennedy, I'm a member of the House of Lords, I'm a practitioner barrister

[632.69–647.95] Helena Kennedy: King's Council of lengthy experience and I now practice in international law, international humanitarian law and the laws of war.

[647.93–651.0] Unknown: And then another colleague I work with, Lord Sedwell.

[651.58–658.41] The Prime Minister: Mark Sedwell, National Security Advisor 2017-20, Cabinet Secretary 2018-20, former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office.

[658.81–662.26] Unknown: Former Ambassador in Afghanistan and National Security Advisor.

[662.8–666.02] The Prime Minister: And National Security Advisor in the exercise.

[666.24–668.62] Unknown: My chief of defence staff is General Barons.

[668.92–677.58] Prime Minister: General Sir Richard Barons, I commanded Joint Forces Command 2013 to 2016, and I've just finished being one of the leaders of the 2025 Defence Review.

[678.12–682.28] Unknown: Just hot on the heels of delivering Labour's current strategic defence review.

[682.8–687.57] Unknown: He's an innovative and forward-thinking general, so that is going to be really great.

[691.13–694.78] Dr Rob Johnson: We also have a chancellor, who you'll meet in episode two.

[694.96–724.23] Dr Rob Johnson: And the scenario is they're flying in from Beijing The Treasury are playing their role perfectly, as ever It's not a joke, they often wouldn't attend meetings It's very normal for the Treasury to miss Cobra Finally, the Prime Minister has a press secretary who's played by Victoria McInnes Victoria McInnes, I'm a communications specialist She's a former civil servant and an expert on communications who works in the defence industry

[726.9–734.15] Dr Rob Johnson: Ben Wallace and his government are being supported by a group of expert advisors who you'll hear more from later.

[734.21–738.96] Dr Rob Johnson: We'll also meet the Russia team once the game is underway.

[745.22–756.46] Dr Rob Johnson: Governments around the world use war games to run through scenarios and test responses for literally anything from health emergencies to World War III.

[757.77–766.7] Dr Rob Johnson: Typically, they're conducted in secret, with the blue and the red teams pitched against each other, each able to act as they choose.

[768.22–776.81] Dr Rob Johnson: In our scenario, though, the red team, while free to make some choices, is already aware of the key steps it will take.

[777.67–785.46] Dr Rob Johnson: By contrast, the blue team knows very little about the scenario and will have to respond to whatever comes its way.

[786.88–795.21] Dr Rob Johnson: As well as running the show, Rob is playing the role of what's known as the Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, or JIC Chair.

[795.25–808.82] Dr Rob Johnson: He'll share updates from the UK's spy agencies, MI6, MI5 and GCHQ, as well as Defence Intelligence, which is part of the Ministry of Defence, or MOD.

[809.8–813.13] Dr Rob Johnson: There are lots of acronyms in the military and the security world.

[813.71–816.09] Dr Rob Johnson: I'll try to spell them out whenever they come up.

[819.25–830.27] Dr Rob Johnson: With the drama about to start... ...Ben and his team have assembled around a long table... ...in the largest of the basement rooms We're now going to open the exercise

[831.48–834.78] Dr Rob Johnson: In the real world, it's a Tuesday morning in early April.

[835.66–841.77] Dr Rob Johnson: In the war game, it's almost six months in the future, and the government is in crisis mode.

[842.96–849.0] Dr Rob Johnson: To set the scene, we've mocked up some rolling news reports from an imagined UK television station.

[850.23–854.53] Dr Rob Johnson: Everyone stops talking and listens.

[857.48–861.81] News Anchor: It's 8am on Monday 29th September, our top story this morning.

[862.23–869.47] News Anchor: Travel chaos on the railways and the roads after a major power cut left parts of England and Wales without electricity.

[872.25–880.6] News Anchor: Multiple train stations have been forced to close to passengers this morning after what the National Grid is describing as an issue with two generators.

[881.4–884.21] News Anchor: Reports are also coming in of problems on the roads.

[884.35–892.6] News Anchor: Transport for London says some traffic lights in the capital are out of action and police officers may be called in to manage certain junctions.

[892.58–902.83] News Anchor: The disruption comes just three days after simultaneous fires broke out at ferry terminals in Plymouth and Portsmouth, halting Channel Ferry crossings over the weekend.

[903.32–909.0] News Anchor: The Home Office says counter-terrorism officers are now investigating the fires as a precautionary measure.

[909.46–913.39] News Anchor: The security sources say they haven't ruled out foul play.

[914.11–922.13] News Anchor: Last year, the heads of MI6 and the CIA accused Moscow of waging a reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe.

[925.1–929.11] Dr Rob Johnson: Russia has previously denied involvement in any sabotage attacks.

[929.73–934.79] Dr Rob Johnson: And there could, of course, be a perfectly innocent explanation for this transport chaos.

[935.88–937.7] Dr Rob Johnson: For now, the cause is unclear.

[938.74–941.7] Dr Rob Johnson: Then, two days later, this happens.

[943.11–945.61] News Anchor: It's 8am on Wednesday, the 1st of October.

[946.13–946.83] News Anchor: Our top story.

[947.27–953.54] News Anchor: Explosions have ripped through a major naval base in northern Russia, killing and wounding dozens of personnel.

[956.4–963.17] News Anchor: The Russian president has suggested the attack at Severomorsk was linked to the UK and has vowed revenge.

[967.48–974.25] News Anchor: The British government has yet to comment, but Downing Street sources have strongly rejected the allegation of any UK involvement.

[976.29–978.28] News Anchor: We'll bring you more as we get it.

[983.2–989.93] Dr Rob Johnson: As tensions grow between Moscow and London over the next few days, British police make a shocking discovery.

[991.03–994.5] News Anchor: It's 4pm on Sunday 5th October, our top story.

[994.94–1000.91] News Anchor: The Ministry of Defence says two F-35 pilots have been found shot dead in Norfolk.

[1001.31–1006.48] News Anchor: The circumstances of the deaths are not clear and military police are investigating.

[1006.46–1015.09] News Anchor: Both pilots are part of 617 Squadron, which fly the UK's most sophisticated F-35 warplanes out of RAF Marham.

[1018.77–1025.46] News Anchor: In other news, Moscow has recalled its ambassador to London, saying Britain is now considered an unfriendly state.

[1026.06–1035.47] News Anchor: The extraordinary move follows the deadly blasts at a major Russian naval base that the Kremlin has claimed were linked to the UK, but without providing evidence.

[1042.28–1053.82] Dr Rob Johnson: The mysterious killing of two such elite fighter pilots, coupled with the aggressive rhetoric from Moscow, prompts the Prime Minister to convene an emergency COBRA meeting.

[1055.12–1057.32] Dr Rob Johnson: These are held at times of crisis.

[1058.3–1061.35] Dr Rob Johnson: COBRA stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms.

[1063.11–1069.44] Dr Rob Johnson: The war game begins at 5pm on Sunday 5th October 2025.

[1076.35–1089.08] Unknown: I called this after the deaths of the two F-35 pilots coupled with the growing both intelligence and situation with Britain being put at the heart of the messaging from Russia.

[1089.66–1092.52] Unknown: So, thank you colleagues for attending on Sunday afternoon.

[1093.42–1098.07] Unknown: Could I ask the National Security Advisor, Marc San Martin, to follow us through the agenda

[1098.05–1098.85] Unknown: Prime Minister, thanks.

[1099.19–1111.68] The Prime Minister: I suggest we start just by seeing whether there's anything further in terms of threat or other intelligence that we need to know before we come to the various options for action both by you and colleagues.

[1112.52–1115.94] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob gives his first inject of information to the players.

[1116.6–1120.07] Dr Rob Johnson: I'll start with the situation update of where we are.

[1120.81–1124.41] Dr Rob Johnson: There was indeed on the 1st of October a terrorist attack in northern Russia.

[1125.34–1133.82] Dr Rob Johnson: It does appear that in the early hours of that day, over 100 Russian labour personnel were killed in detonations around the port of Murmansk Severomorsk

[1133.8–1135.16] Dr Rob Johnson: and its residential area.

[1135.72–1142.98] Dr Rob Johnson: GCHQ did a lot of work to try and identify who had been behind this particular attack.

[1143.84–1148.61] Dr Rob Johnson: Rather curiously, there were some inferences that darker styles are involved

[1149.57–1155.18] Dr Rob Johnson: The intelligence is referring to Islamist extremists from the Russian Republic of Dagestan.

[1156.0–1164.34] Dr Rob Johnson: It suggests their motivation for launching the attack could be anger at Moscow for recruiting their men to fight in Ukraine.

[1164.94–1174.35] Dr Rob Johnson: The Russian government announced that they needed little further evidence to confirm that this was an attack by British intelligence using divers.

[1174.59–1176.9] Dr Rob Johnson: I think we can dismiss this nonsense.

[1177.87–1185.82] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob then shares information from MI5 on the two F-35 pilots whose bodies were found early in the morning.

[1187.42–1189.91] Dr Rob Johnson: Both appear to have died on Saturday night.

[1190.61–1192.61] Dr Rob Johnson: Police investigations are ongoing.

[1193.19–1199.34] Dr Rob Johnson: We have low confidence in the intelligence so far, but it's likely that these men were tracked before they were killed.

[1201.08–1204.08] Dr Rob Johnson: He highlights two other important developments.

[1204.94–1215.33] Dr Rob Johnson: Signals intelligence reveals that there is a snap Russian naval exercise underway today involving rehearsals for the deployment of surface-to-surface missiles in the North Atlantic.

[1216.49–1226.31] Dr Rob Johnson: What they also note at Cheltenham is the intensity of cyber attacks on UK businesses and government websites has increased by a magnitude of 65%.

[1227.67–1234.64] Dr Rob Johnson: Cheltenham refers to the location of GCHQ, the government's signals and cyber intelligence agency.

[1234.68–1244.14] Dr Rob Johnson: While the cause of the rise in cyber attacks isn't clear, it could be yet another sign of hostile Russian activity.

[1246.03–1257.0] Dr Rob Johnson: The National Security Advisor is interested in what appears to be an exceptionally large Russian naval exercise involving warships, aircraft and submarines.

[1258.33–1261.99] Dr Rob Johnson: It's being tracked by American, Norwegian and British ships.

[1263.67–1267.52] Dr Rob Johnson: When he says CDS, he means Chief of the Defence Staff.

[1268.3–1273.51] Dr Rob Johnson: That's the Prime Minister's top military advisor and head of the UK Armed Forces.

[1275.34–1286.41] The Prime Minister: PM perhaps from CDS, just more on this Russian naval exercise and how we're monitoring it, and in particular CDS, do you have any concerns about how they're operating in these circumstances?

[1287.66–1288.68] Prime Minister: Yes, thank you.

[1288.8–1293.99] Prime Minister: So, Prime Minister, if I may, from the military perspective, I'd like to widen this discussion a little bit.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1294.53–1299.29] Prime Minister: I think it's becoming clear that the country is being subject to a wide range of coercion.

[1300.23–1312.59] Prime Minister: We've seen the attacks on the railway, the likely attacks on the traffic infrastructure in London and the ferry fires, and now we have had two F-35 pilots murdered.

[1314.46–1323.35] Prime Minister: And I have to say that if we fit all of those things together, the murder of the pilots is a traditional special forces activity.

[1323.43–1328.02] Prime Minister: So we should not indulge ourselves by thinking that was some sort of accident.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1331.7–1335.71] Dr Rob Johnson: Killing pilots was part of the Soviet playbook during the Cold War.

[1336.9–1358.49] Dr Rob Johnson: Richard Barrons, the general who's playing our defence chief, once told me about a Czech special forces officer whose task in the run-up to war, once he'd smuggled himself into the UK, would have been to go to the officer's mess at an RAF base in Lincolnshire on a Friday night during happy hour and shoot all the pilots.

[1361.34–1370.07] Dr Rob Johnson: And when you think about it, a 9mm bullet is a much more efficient way of grounding an air force than a barrage of missiles.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1370.69–1385.96] Prime Minister: So what I've done so far is I have made sure that all the pilots of our F-35 and Typhoon aircraft are now coming into their bases and they will stay there with their families until the situation is clearer.

[1386.64–1389.17] Dr Rob Johnson: This means they'll have additional security.

[1390.21–1396.06] Prime Minister: To answer the National Security Advisor's direct question, we are monitoring a Russian exercise in the North Atlantic.

[1396.82–1397.94] Prime Minister: There are two dimensions to this.

[1398.12–1404.95] Prime Minister: One is, as reported, the Russian nuclear bomber submarines are coming into the Atlantic.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1405.01–1407.58] Prime Minister: Now, they could threaten the UK from anywhere in the Atlantic.

[1408.57–1417.87] Prime Minister: and the two other submarines that carry cruise missiles could threaten the UK with conventional attack from certainly the eastern half of the Atlantic.

[1417.93–1424.42] Prime Minister: So my concern as CDS now is that we are managing a great deal of Russian coercion.

[1424.8–1429.29] Prime Minister: We can't exclude that we're on the threshold of this becoming a military attack of the UK.

[1429.33–1431.11] Prime Minister: This might all be precursor activity.

[1431.82–1440.53] Prime Minister: And I need to get the armed forces ready for that without, of course, provoking Russia into the one activity we would wish them to avoid.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1441.33–1448.68] Prime Minister: So I'm going to ask that we begin to concentrate some of the military units in their bases, and I may even disperse them.

[1449.24–1452.25] Prime Minister: I need to start outloading some supplies so that we're not caught short.

[1454.56–1467.57] Dr Rob Johnson: He's talking about ordering troops to their barracks, potentially getting them to spread out to other sites, and ensuring things like ammunition, fuel and other supplies are brought out of storage.

[1468.56–1473.17] The Prime Minister: PM, if I may, I think we have to assume that essentially we're now being put to the test.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1473.63–1476.11] The Prime Minister: There's a series of unconventional activities by the Russians.

[1476.62–1484.93] The Prime Minister: We mustn't jump to conclusions, I certainly mustn't say that publicly, but potentially arson attacks, possibly these two assassinations are not a believer in coincidence.

[1485.45–1491.26] The Prime Minister: And now we have them essentially raising readiness in terms of the deployment of their naval forces.

[1491.73–1495.93] Dr Rob Johnson: Like many around the table, he's encountered Russian aggression before.

[1497.04–1513.35] Dr Rob Johnson: Mark Sedwell was the real national security adviser when the UK accused Vladimir Putin's Russia of attempting to kill the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury in 2018.

[1514.99–1517.1] Dr Rob Johnson: Moscow has always denied involvement.

[1518.24–1528.8] Dr Rob Johnson: Mark led efforts, alongside Amber Rudd as the Home Secretary and Ben Wallace as Security Minister at the time, to rally NATO allies to retaliate to the attack.

[1529.98–1535.28] Dr Rob Johnson: It had left the Skripals critically ill and killed a British woman Dawn Sturgis.

[1536.29–1543.45] Dr Rob Johnson: More than 20 nations agreed to a mass expulsion of alleged Russian spies from their respective countries.

[1545.44–1553.43] The Prime Minister: And I suspect what they're doing, as Putin always does, channeling the old Leninist doctrine, keep pushing and if you meet steel retreat, if you meet mush keep going.

[1553.53–1562.58] The Prime Minister: And so I think he is putting us and NATO to the test and we should work on the assumption that this will continue until and unless we respond.

[1562.64–1566.61] The Prime Minister: I think the discussion PM, if I may suggest, should take place in that context.

[1567.43–1568.21] The Prime Minister: OK, good.

RED
============================================================

[1662.03–1667.54] Unknown: A British frogman's outfit has been discovered on a beach near the Severomorsk naval base.

[1668.56–1676.54] Unknown: The head of the investigation into last Wednesday's attack says this is powerful evidence of British involvement in the terrorist atrocity.

[1677.56–1686.37] Unknown: Several experts have likened the suspected British operation to the Nazi surprise attack on the Soviet Union in 1941.

[1686.69–1690.19] Unknown: It is just the latest example of British-sponsored terrorism.

[1691.01–1698.22] Unknown: As you know, the UK has been the closest backer of the Nazi regime in Ukraine.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1704.43–1705.43] Keir Giles: I'm Keir Giles.

[1705.71–1707.99] Keir Giles: I study and explain Russia for a living.

[1708.66–1713.62] Keir Giles: I've written a number of books about what Russia does, why it does it and what it's going to do next.

[1716.12–1719.36] Keir Giles: I'm playing the president of Russia in this war game.

[1720.78–1729.8] Dr Rob Johnson: The Kremlin, for the purpose of the game, is in another room, separated from the British side by a corridor, a hall and a couple of doors.

[1731.18–1741.42] Dr Rob Johnson: Kir is joined by three other experts, each with experience of playing the Russia side in war games to help Western allies better understand the threat posed by Moscow.

[1742.36–1748.85] Keir Giles: There's Toms Rostok from Latvia, who is going to be playing the chief of the general staff, so in charge of the Russian military.

[1749.85–1754.7] Dr Rob Johnson: In real life, Toms is a director of the National Defence Academy of Latvia.

[1755.3–1757.98] Dr Rob Johnson: He's flown to London especially for the war game.

[1759.16–1761.35] Dr Rob Johnson: It's October in the game.

[1761.39–1766.58] Dr Rob Johnson: This may go down in history as the British missile crisis.

[1766.94–1772.69] Russian President: It also luckily coincides with the birthday of our beloved leader and president.

[1773.8–1783.27] Dr Rob Johnson: Also just off a flight is Maria Engvist, deputy head of the Russia and Eurasia studies programme at the Swedish Defence Research Agency.

[1783.93–1786.47] Keir Giles: She's going to be playing the head of military intelligence.

[1787.43–1791.08] Russian President: Yeah, 7th of October, if I do not remember incorrectly.

[1791.67–1801.04] Dr Rob Johnson: Known as the GRU, this is the agency that the UK believes carried out the Salisbury spy poisonings and many other hostile acts.

[1801.94–1804.5] Keir Giles: And then dining in remotely, we have Robin Hagblom.

[1804.52–1809.67] Keir Giles: He is a naval analyst from Finland and he will be playing the commander of Russia's Northern Fleet.

[1810.11–1816.46] Russian President: The Navy is very eager to take this opportunity to be able to extract revenge for the terrorist attack at Cevermosh.

[1819.49–1824.27] Dr Rob Johnson: Appearing via video link, his backdrop shows the inside of a warship.

[1824.91–1825.75] Keir Giles: He's got a good backdrop.

[1826.11–1827.7] Russian President: Robin looks very operational.

[1828.86–1831.6] Dr Rob Johnson: In reality, he's in his office in Finland.

[1832.52–1837.35] Dr Rob Johnson: Robin is a senior advisor at a risk assessment company called Risk Intelligence.

[1838.55–1849.32] Dr Rob Johnson: And despite what he said about extracting revenge, no one on the Russian team really believes the UK had anything to do with the explosions at their naval base.

[1850.08–1857.68] Dr Rob Johnson: It is our assessment that it was the terrorist attack carried out by the Pakistani extremists.

[1858.47–1862.52] Dr Rob Johnson: The Chief of the General Staff has just been asked who was responsible.

[1863.38–1868.03] Dr Rob Johnson: He too blames Dagestani militants, echoing the British assessment.

[1868.71–1869.05] Keir Giles: Very good.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1869.33–1871.05] Keir Giles: Thank you colleagues, I approve of your assessment.

[1871.23–1882.07] Keir Giles: We will deal with our Dagestani terrorists at another time, but this provides a historic opportunity to neutralise the Anglo-Saxons as an obstacle to our objectives.

[1882.69–1889.44] Keir Giles: I agree with your recommendation that we should use the Severomovsk attack as a pretext for launching Operation Tuman.

[1890.48–1894.4] Dr Rob Johnson: This is the secret code name the Russian side has given its attack plan.

[1896.23–1898.37] Dr Rob Johnson: The word means fog in Russian.

[1901.23–1906.22] Dr Rob Johnson: The president asks his spy chief whether she thinks the US will help the UK.

[1906.96–1913.79] Russian President: It is the assessment of my agency that the US have no interest in engaging in war fighting in Europe.

[1913.81–1917.73] Russian President: Britain and the US have drifted apart increasingly during the past years.

[1918.82–1922.0] Russian President: US resources remain focused in the Indo-Pacific.

[1922.3–1928.17] Russian President: This is a bold and necessary operation that will effectively be the end of NATO.

[1929.59–1934.08] Dr Rob Johnson: The commander of the Northern Fleet gives an update on the readiness of his flotilla.

[1936.02–1946.55] Russian President: As we have been able to prepare for these strikes for two months, we are in a relatively good shape, though of course we have not been able to create any miracles or add new units to the fleet in this time.

[1947.77–1955.94] Keir Giles: So to confirm, Admiral, we are not expecting that the United Kingdom is able to defend realistically against our missiles, is that correct?

[1957.0–1957.72] Russian President: That is correct.

[1959.99–1965.82] Russian President: The number of air defenses they have available able to intercept our missiles is very limited.

[1965.86–1970.11] Russian President: We have a significant number of missiles aboard our ships and submarines.

[1970.53–1971.66] Russian President: This should not be an issue.

[1975.92–1993.43] Dr Rob Johnson: He's identified a glaring vulnerability here that, as with most of Britain's military cuts, can be traced back to the end of the Cold War, when successive governments ran down their ability to defeat attacks from the sky to save cash.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1993.41–2001.42] Dr Rob Johnson: Today, only a handful of RAF squadrons and a limited number of army systems can intercept cruise missiles.

[2002.47–2008.68] Dr Rob Johnson: These are self-guided weapons propelled by a jet engine that are powered all the way onto a target.

[2009.96–2026.72] Dr Rob Johnson: As for ballistic missiles, which are blasted to a high altitude, even out of the Earth's atmosphere, before dropping at a steep angle onto a target at great speed, the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyers are the UK's sole line of defence.

[2027.77–2038.45] Dr Rob Johnson: But it only has six of these billion-pound warships, and four are routinely unavailable because of maintenance woes and crew shortages.

[2039.5–2045.54] Dr Rob Johnson: One of them, HMS Daring, has spent more years being fixed than out at sea.

[2047.16–2055.39] Dr Rob Johnson: A NATO command base in Germany is responsible for defending the airspace of the whole Alliance, including the UK.

[2055.89–2063.14] Dr Rob Johnson: However, British forces would be the first line of defence against any threats coming straight at them from the Atlantic.

[2067.91–2073.38] Keir Giles: Chief of General Staff, I would like to hear from you about our overall military position.

[2073.8–2081.13] Dr Rob Johnson: The president is now asking his defence chief about the overall state of Russia's armed forces given their war in Ukraine.

[2081.82–2093.27] Dr Rob Johnson: Of course, much attention has been paid in past years on the special military operation and the losses that we have suffered during that operation.

[2094.27–2096.43] Dr Rob Johnson: And those losses have been significant.

[2096.85–2111.7] Dr Rob Johnson: However, in terms of military personnel, we have recovered and our military in the coming years will be even larger than it was before the start of the special military operation.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[2112.41–2117.12] Keir Giles: So for a target like the United Kingdom, we are in as strong a position as we were before.

[2117.96–2121.69] Dr Rob Johnson: Yes, and we are certainly in a stronger position than the UK.

[2123.3–2129.59] Keir Giles: Thank you for your assessment.

[2132.32–2137.39] Dr Rob Johnson: Back in London, Amber Rudd, playing the Home Secretary, has an update for the COBRA meeting.

[2137.75–2138.49] Unknown: I'm so sorry.

[2138.51–2142.34] Unknown: I've got some urgent news, Prime Minister, so I feel it ought to be on the table.

[2143.38–2148.69] Unknown: We've heard from MI5 that Russian families are leaving the UK, and that includes diplomatic staff.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2149.59–2156.86] Unknown: I mean, I would suggest that our immediate inquiry, our return at this date, to find out from JIC whether we have any further intelligence from

[2156.84–2167.58] Unknown: MI6, perhaps, who might know more about some intentions, but the fact that Russian staff are leaving at speed is... Do we have any reports of the activity of the Russian intelligence officers in the embassy?

[2167.6–2174.14] Unknown: As in, do we see any activity of Russians, GRU or whatever, in the UK?

[2174.18–2175.11] Unknown: Has that changed?

[2176.07–2178.55] Unknown: I think I'd ask Duke Cher about that, if I may.

[2178.57–2181.63] Dr Rob Johnson: We'll put on that an immediate investigation, Prime Minister.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2183.96–2191.37] Dr Rob Johnson: The exodus of a number of Russian families is a further indicator that something bad is heading the UK's way.

[2191.62–2203.12] Unknown: Prime Minister, can I ask, as the CDS said in his earlier remarks, this is an escalation of the squeeze we've felt from the Russians in terms of their attacks on the UK and on other European countries as well.

[2203.9–2207.74] Unknown: Do you have any view, Prime Minister, or perhaps the Foreign Secretary, about what the Russians are after?

[2207.76–2209.12] Unknown: What are they trying to achieve?

[2209.49–2218.88] Unknown: Is it anything in particular, or is it retaliation for an event that took place that we weren't in fact responsible for, but they want to show a response to?

[2219.08–2225.31] Unknown: One of the challenges is Russia has a long track record of false flag for the purpose of its own agenda.

[2226.57–2237.48] Dr Rob Johnson: A false flag can mean an action like a bombing or an assassination that's done by one side but blamed on the other to create a fake pretext to attack them.

[2238.38–2245.35] Dr Rob Johnson: Attribution is also typically hard, making it difficult for the accused to prove their innocence.

[2246.47–2253.7] Dr Rob Johnson: In this case, the Russian government did not deliberately target its own naval base, but it knows who did.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[2253.74–2264.64] Dr Rob Johnson: Yet the Kremlin is using the atrocity as a way to falsely smear the British and excuse whatever activity it plans to do next.

[2264.99–2270.26] Unknown: We saw that in the build-up to the Ukraine war, which was exposed by the West on a number of occasions.

[2271.42–2277.33] Unknown: And so there is almost nothing ever off-limit with the Russians in how they currently function.

[2277.41–2279.8] Unknown: He should know.

[2279.82–2292.23] Dr Rob Johnson: When Ben Wallace was the UK's real defence secretary, he was a leading voice in 2021, raising the alarm about the impending threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2293.48–2303.1] Dr Rob Johnson: He was also instrumental in rushing out British weapons to Ukrainian forces to help them fend off the initial onslaught the following year.

[2303.64–2308.57] Unknown: So it could be they genuinely believe we are behind this attack.

[2308.61–2317.08] Unknown: My own experience, when the Russians were obsessed that there was a dirty bomb in Ukraine, I had a phone call with my Russian defense counterpart.

[2317.1–2320.68] Unknown: He contacted me, my Turkish counterpart and my French counterpart.

[2320.93–2325.81] Unknown: Interesting choice of people him to contact when we were in one summer.

[2326.05–2332.23] Unknown: they were determined that the British and others were behind a dirty bomb, totally untrue and false.

[2332.51–2338.12] Unknown: And to this day, I would still be guessing whether they believed it or whether they made it up themselves.

[2338.68–2350.45] Unknown: So I think we could only really look at their physical deployment as the marker and trying to undo the riddle, could be a lot of energy, the riddle behind it all.

[2351.58–2355.24] Dr Rob Johnson: Helena Kennedy, as the Attorney General, offers her view.

[2355.26–2361.43] Helena Kennedy: They could be testing whether the NATO alliance is actually as solid as it once was.

[2362.03–2366.38] Helena Kennedy: And we know that that fragility is one of the issues that concerns us.

[2366.86–2368.93] Helena Kennedy: And they may be actually putting that to the test.

[2368.95–2369.87] Unknown: Always punching the bruise.

[2370.33–2380.3] Dr Rob Johnson: Suddenly, the chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee interrupts.

[2380.93–2387.82] Dr Rob Johnson: So we've just had two injects, one from Defence Intelligence, which is also replicated from the information coming from SIS.

[2389.72–2392.47] Dr Rob Johnson: SIS is another acronym for MI6.

[2393.07–2395.13] Dr Rob Johnson: It means Secret Intelligence Service.

[2396.27–2401.48] Dr Rob Johnson: Rob reveals that more submarines have joined the Russian flotilla in the North Atlantic.

[2402.12–2412.41] Dr Rob Johnson: And we estimate the total now out of Severomorsk is seven SSBNs, which is the entire Northern Fleet Bar 1, eight SSNs.

[2412.97–2417.75] Unknown: Just for clarity, SSBN is the bombers, and SSN are the hunter-killer submarines.

[2418.03–2418.41] Unknown: That's correct.

[2418.43–2422.3] Unknown: That's 15 submarines in the North Atlantic.

[2423.28–2424.24] The Prime Minister: Well, and PM clustered.

[2425.42–2427.5] The Prime Minister: That's the very striking thing.

[2428.38–2430.09] The Prime Minister: I don't know if the CDS, if you were sitting

[2430.67–2441.31] Dr Rob Johnson: A screen in the Cobra Room lights up with a map that shows the Russian deployment also includes two large destroyers and four frigates.

[2441.33–2444.53] Dr Rob Johnson: These are medium-sized ships armed with missiles.

[2446.05–2452.02] Dr Rob Johnson: Such a formidable display of naval power is the biggest warning sign yet from Moscow.

[2453.28–2456.95] Dr Rob Johnson: This is well above the normal complement that we would expect to see deployed.

[2457.61–2459.59] Dr Rob Johnson: They've all assembled at a rendezvous point.

[2460.45–2466.98] Dr Rob Johnson: But you can see from our map that they are moving in a southwesterly direction.

[2467.46–2476.95] Dr Rob Johnson: And there are active Russian air operations over the North Atlantic, all of which are being tracked by our own surveillance sites and by our own surveillance aircraft and by American satellites.

[2477.41–2482.62] Unknown: Put it in perspective for others around the table, normally, roughly, you'd get

[2483.29–2489.43] Unknown: three to five submarines lurking around the Atlantic, Russian, American, French, British.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[2490.36–2499.51] Unknown: To have 15 from just one power alone is extraordinary and takes a huge amount of effort, actually, by any country to see that many submarines.

[2499.53–2502.61] Unknown: So it is definitely out of the ordinary.

[2503.17–2505.09] The Prime Minister: I don't know the CDS, you've got a view.

[2505.73–2509.72] The Prime Minister: If you were sitting in your Russian counterparts' chair,

[2509.7–2514.03] The Prime Minister: what the basis would be for deploying not only that number but in that concentration.

[2516.14–2519.07] Prime Minister: So in my view this is clearly an enormous show of force.

[2522.57–2526.62] Prime Minister: It's quite out of any form of normal pattern.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2527.18–2529.9] Prime Minister: All of this activity is in international waters and airspace.

[2530.34–2535.27] Prime Minister: So it's still at some distance, but also protected by international law.

[2536.37–2541.1] Prime Minister: It is heading around the UK, but it remains in range of the UK.

[2542.08–2545.15] Prime Minister: The best outcome is that this is just a show of force.

[2545.77–2550.55] Prime Minister: The worst outcome is this is setting a force in order to attack the UK.

[2552.68–2560.85] Dr Rob Johnson: The national security adviser explains this is not just a problem for the UK, it's a challenge to the whole of the NATO alliance.

[2562.12–2567.99] Dr Rob Johnson: All 32 member states share responsibility for defending their land, seas and skies.

[2569.13–2576.92] The Prime Minister: There are NATO protocols for this, and we're obviously anxious in the current circumstances that those protocols might not apply.

[2577.62–2593.14] The Prime Minister: But if we can just at least test by presuming that they will, do it perhaps on the professional military channel first, CDS perhaps, and just almost presume that they're going to operate as we've always understood they will.

[2593.16–2596.49] The Prime Minister: And then if it looks as though they won't, we then escalate to the political level.

[2597.8–2603.8] Dr Rob Johnson: He's referring here to uncertainty about the United States' commitment to defending Europe.

[2605.5–2610.28] Dr Rob Johnson: Jack Straw, speaking as the Foreign Secretary, is far more blunt.

[2612.16–2615.85] Jack Straw: Prime Minister, the elephant in the room here is what the US is going to do.

[2616.47–2621.41] Jack Straw: In the past, we were confident that the US would be with us.

[2622.18–2631.59] Jack Straw: Now, the question I raise is, as well as quotes hitting the phone to professional opposite numbers in NATO headquarters and command centres.

[2631.72–2637.28] Jack Straw: Do we also hit the phones in my case to talk to the American Secretary of State?

[2637.84–2642.22] Jack Straw: Because if we are able to get a situation where the US

[2642.28–2662.66] Jack Straw: understands that this is a threat against them as well as against us, then we're in a very, very different position to be able to deter Russia from a situation where the Russians can take great comfort from the fact that the United States is simply going to sit on its hands because...


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[2662.64–2677.17] Dr Rob Johnson: Until recently, it would have been implausible even to contemplate the possibility of the United States not immediately mobilizing to help defend the UK in the face of such a show of force by Russia.

[2677.19–2679.85] Dr Rob Johnson: Not so much anymore.

[2681.29–2690.6] Dr Rob Johnson: Washington has repeatedly warned its NATO allies to stop relying so heavily on American protection and do more to defend themselves.

[2691.8–2701.35] Dr Rob Johnson: At the same time, the White House has been seeking to forge better relations with Moscow to the dismay of London and most other western capitals.

[2704.02–2710.31] Dr Rob Johnson: It's an upending of a security landscape that's been in place since the end of the Second World War.

[2712.62–2714.52] Unknown: I think the foreign secretary is absolutely right.

[2715.47–2719.97] Unknown: To start point really is with the United States here and secondly then NATO.

[2720.01–2727.84] Unknown: The two bodies we have taken partly for granted but we have definitely taken as our guarantor for 70 odd years.

[2728.73–2732.97] Unknown: I think in this situation we should absolutely take that for starter.

[2734.09–2743.32] Dr Rob Johnson: The British side also needs to prepare its own military and society for the possibility of the home front being turned into a war zone.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2744.51–2751.0] Dr Rob Johnson: It's something no prime minister has seriously considered or planned for since the 1980s.

[2751.64–2757.07] The Prime Minister: I was just going to suggest, Peter, because those of us who need to put it into effect need to get out of this room and get those actions going.

[2757.09–2759.53] Unknown: Could we do the readiness for assurance?

[2759.55–2762.76] Unknown: Readiness in itself is a deterrent to people.

[2762.88–2766.91] Unknown: So if I could start, first of all, with CDS and Defence Secretary

[2767.21–2767.65] Unknown: on that.

[2768.05–2770.91] Unknown: What is our ability to either change our readiness?

[2771.7–2776.46] Unknown: What ideas do you have to increase our readiness both at sea, land and air?


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2776.48–2787.56] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): PM, as CDS said earlier on, he's already advising that forces be concentrated and early steps are taken to mobilise and outload supplies.

[2788.06–2789.7] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): CDS, do you want to expand on that?

[2790.4–2795.23] Prime Minister: So I suggest that we apply the P-8 reconnaissance aircraft that we have.

[2796.08–2801.89] Prime Minister: the currently one only but shortly two Type 23 anti-submarine frigates that we can put to sea.

[2803.01–2815.47] Dr Rob Johnson: The Chief of the Defence Staff, CDS, also says one, if possible two, Royal Navy attack submarines are being deployed to help monitor the Russian flotilla.

[2816.65–2820.66] Dr Rob Johnson: He also has plans for one of the UK's two aircraft carriers.

[2821.75–2829.64] Prime Minister: I recommend that although it's not at the highest state of readiness, that we put the Prince of Wales carrier to sea.

[2830.36–2833.83] Prime Minister: I believe I can get eight F-35s on board it.

[2834.63–2840.05] Prime Minister: And we send it into the North Atlantic between the Russian group and the UK.

[2840.09–2843.2] Prime Minister: It will take some days to get there.

[2843.22–2850.73] Dr Rob Johnson: This October, in the real world, the Navy's three billion pound carrier will actually be on the other side of the globe.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[2852.78–2858.2] Dr Rob Johnson: The warship left Portsmouth back in April on an eight-month deployment to the Indo-Pacific.

[2861.5–2871.06] Dr Rob Johnson: It's accompanied by a Type 45 destroyer and up to 24 of the UK's F-35 jets, leaving Britain even less well defended.

[2872.56–2894.07] Dr Rob Johnson: In the war game, though... ...we've imagined that the trip was cancelled... ...amid escalating tensions with Russia... ...so the ships and aircraft are available to fight The Prime Minister has a recommendation as well Could you also look at readying the second Trident SSBN?


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2894.99–2901.72] Dr Rob Johnson: He's referring to the UK's nuclear-armed submarines Obviously we always have one at sea on patrol...

[2902.14–2910.14] Unknown: And while we know one's in refit and there are three others, I would be grateful if we look at the readiness of that.

[2911.95–2917.92] Dr Rob Johnson: It's the most dramatic move yet by the British side, underlining the gravity of the crisis.

[2919.36–2922.84] Dr Rob Johnson: The Navy has a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines.

[2923.98–2930.99] Dr Rob Johnson: One is always deployed on a rotating basis, providing what's known as the continuous at-sea deterrence.

[2932.19–2938.04] Dr Rob Johnson: That means it's ready to fire nuclear weapons to defend the UK if given the order.

[2939.53–2948.84] Dr Rob Johnson: Preparing to put a second submarine out from its base at Fazlane in Scotland would send a clear signal to Moscow to back off.

[2949.93–2956.18] Unknown: And let's not forget that that boat is perfectly possible to operate alongside, even if it's not at sea.

[2956.82–2962.47] Dr Rob Johnson: He means the submarine can still fire nuclear weapons from its moorings if necessary.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2963.21–2965.95] Unknown: So from the Russian point of view, it'll be viewed as a threat.

[2970.34–2979.59] Dr Rob Johnson: As for the UK homeland, the defence chief is doing the best he can, in coordination with NATO, to defend as much as possible.

[2979.8–2987.84] Prime Minister: What I recommend is that we surge the Royal Air Force to produce two 24-hour combat air patrols.

[2988.56–2993.89] Prime Minister: One vital piece of guidance I need from you, I can protect two areas of the UK on a 24-hour basis.

[2994.23–2995.19] Prime Minister: I need to prioritise.

[2995.69–2999.5] Dr Rob Johnson: He says one has to be the Fazlane submarine base.

[2999.83–3002.1] Prime Minister: You've asked me about the second Trident boat.

[3002.66–3010.35] Prime Minister: I need to put one of those combat air patrols over Faslane or the nuclear architecture will be very vulnerable.

[3010.69–3014.44] Prime Minister: And the second one I propose to put over and around London.

[3015.48–3015.99] Prime Minister: That's it.

[3018.45–3020.81] Dr Rob Johnson: It's a pretty devastating admission.

[3021.87–3031.12] Dr Rob Johnson: The military chief is saying his air force only has the capacity to defend two sites in total across the whole of the UK.

[3031.18–3039.32] Dr Rob Johnson: The prime minister isn't so sure London should be one of them.

[3040.02–3043.74] Unknown: In terms of military vulnerability,

[3044.3–3056.47] Unknown: Is London the priority if this was an attack by Russia that, you know, randomly hitting suburbs of London is not going to

[3059.1–3067.79] Unknown: It's not going to deteriorate our capabilities as opposed to putting those patrols somewhere like over the RAF bases of East Anglia.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[3068.23–3075.64] Prime Minister: So that depends how you feel about Whitehall and the centre of government and everything else that sits in and around the centre of London.

[3076.52–3084.84] Unknown: Yes to Fazlaine, the second deployment for now, not London, but over the key military infrastructures that you consider.

[3090.8–3095.29] Dr Rob Johnson: James Heapey, our Defence Secretary, then speaks.

[3095.31–3104.17] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): It's also worth noting that the activity that CDS describes is a not insignificant outload of UK military resource.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[3104.61–3107.05] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): And I think that that brings with it two issues.

[3107.53–3113.3] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): Firstly, that we will not be able to deploy that amount of force in secret.

[3113.44–3117.05] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): Indeed, you may not want to deploy it in secret, but we need to think carefully

[3117.03–3122.76] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): about what the messaging is that we attach to the outload of those forces.

[3123.24–3133.34] CDS (Chief of Defence Staff): But secondly it won't escape the notice of many in the commentariat that what we do deploy is still overmatched by what the Russians have deployed as well.

[3134.44–3137.25] Dr Rob Johnson: As they talk, another update comes in.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[3137.89–3149.18] Prime Minister: Forgive me, I have one piece of news which is I understand that an Akula class Russian submarine has surfaced off Orkney and it's then paralleled the commercial ferry and then submerged.

[3150.0–3151.32] Dr Rob Johnson: Imagine this.

[3152.45–3159.0] Dr Rob Johnson: You're on a ferry to the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland along with dozens of other passengers.

[3160.12–3167.51] Dr Rob Johnson: You look out the window and see a giant grey attack submarine pop up out the water and then dive again.

[3167.53–3173.82] Dr Rob Johnson: People would surely pull out their phones to take videos and photographs to share online.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[3174.1–3176.78] Prime Minister: That is exceptional activity.

[3176.84–3178.85] Prime Minister: It's clearly threatening and it's messaging to us.

[3179.15–3185.41] Prime Minister: It's also public, so we'll not be able to keep that a secret in a way that a Russian deployment in the North Atlantic might be a secret.

[3185.43–3189.04] Unknown: I mean, this is clearly breaking out nationally, CDS.

[3189.06–3194.85] Unknown: They've been seeing it, but also the fact that the Russian diplomats and their families are leaving is now all over Twitter.

[3194.87–3196.11] Dr Rob Johnson: The Home Secretary

[3196.64–3204.49] Unknown: So it's going to be very evident that the Russians are signalling that there may be, let's call it what it is Prime Minister, there may be an attack.

[3210.84–3214.76] Unknown: I think we just have to be cautious of the word attack at the moment.

[3215.05–3224.06] Unknown: We have to prepare ourselves, we have to be determined and focused, clear messaging of denial.

[3224.08–3232.56] Unknown: The most important fish to catch at this phase is a strong US commitment and NATO commitment to this.

[3232.89–3247.24] Unknown: At the same time, a lot of work in the Civil Contingency Secretariat to make sure we prepare our domestic defences, MI5, police leave, consider whether we cancel police leave, etc.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[3247.96–3250.58] Unknown: to make sure we can maximise our readiness.

[3250.9–3252.82] Unknown: If I may, PM, I agree with all that.

[3253.06–3256.48] Unknown: I just think we need to just think how we're going to message to the public as this escalates.

[3257.12–3269.26] Unknown: And I would really like to have, I don't know whether you're going to be doing media or the press secretary is going to be doing the media, but just some reassuring words, but also acknowledging the threat that we're under, because that will be available.

[3269.3–3276.37] Unknown: So Home Secretary, as the guardian of the domestic threat, I would ask you after this meeting to do

[3276.35–3287.68] Unknown: The media, reassurance around civilian infrastructure, civilians, a reassurance about investigation of the F-35 pilots.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[3290.08–3297.39] Dr Rob Johnson: The Prime Minister also tasks his defence secretary with releasing comments about what the armed forces will be doing.

[3297.78–3303.45] Unknown: a rather crisp and factual current defense statement about we have deployed.

[3304.59–3310.45] Unknown: We've seen unprecedented sort of keywords, you know, unprecedented deployments working with allies.

[3310.61–3314.32] Unknown: So reassurance from defense sort of

[3314.3–3318.41] Unknown: We have a plan from the Home Office, which I always think is important, to communicate you have a plan.

[3318.51–3318.71] Unknown: Yes.

[3318.89–3320.23] Unknown: That's the most important thing.

[3320.85–3323.39] The Prime Minister: I think you have to go, if I may.

[3323.41–3325.26] The Prime Minister: I think we all have our homework to do.

[3325.28–3328.04] The Prime Minister: Foreign Secretary and I will start working the phones.

[3328.12–3330.29] The Prime Minister: We'll get you engaged as we need to.

[3331.23–3332.31] The Prime Minister: Thank you very much indeed.

[3332.33–3333.05] Dr Rob Johnson: Break, break, break.

[3334.7–3335.28] Dr Rob Johnson: Thank you.

[3339.71–3348.74] Dr Rob Johnson: As Rob Johnson ends the session in the Cobra Room, though, the defence chief steps out and walks across the corridor to a second room.

[3349.9–3358.41] Dr Rob Johnson: Inside, the top operational commander has gathered a team of advisors to discuss the UK's limited options to defend itself.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[3365.02–3366.02] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): CGO, hello.

[3367.18–3368.17] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): Morning, CDS.

[3368.99–3379.22] Dr Rob Johnson: Lieutenant General Sir David Capewell is a highly regarded and hugely experienced Royal Marines officer who spent almost four decades serving in the armed forces.

[3380.83–3386.07] Dr Rob Johnson: He's reprising his former job as Chief of Joint Operations or CJO.

[3387.29–3393.32] Dr Rob Johnson: In an emergency like this, he'd be an overall command of UK forces in the fight.

[3393.92–3395.39] Prime Minister: I've just come from Cobra.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[3395.62–3400.85] Prime Minister: It would be fair to say there's quite a lot of disquiet of what's going on.

[3401.53–3402.81] Prime Minister: Considerable uncertainty.

[3403.45–3407.24] Prime Minister: But I have some instructions which we are going to have to tackle at speed.

[3408.06–3418.8] Dr Rob Johnson: The defence chief lists the tasks, from defending the UK airspace to tracking the Russian flotilla, despite far too few jets, ships and missiles.

[3419.86–3421.76] Prime Minister: Everybody knows we can't do it all.

[3422.18–3427.15] Dr Rob Johnson: He also says there's a big question mark over whether NATO is going to help.

[3427.85–3428.97] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): Thank you, CDS.

[3429.43–3441.81] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): We can definitely get on with the planning necessary to provide the protection and oversight and surveillance requirements that you've described.

[3442.33–3452.22] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): But right at the back of my mind is that we are beginning to see the mortgaging of risk from political intent to operational reality.

[3452.76–3467.68] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): And the operational reality is that we are extremely thin on the ground and will require quite a lot of negotiation with NATO, who will also be feeling the same pressure to do something nationally as opposed to collectively.

[3468.43–3482.44] Prime Minister: So in the spirit of the Cobra meeting, it was not the time for us to have a protracted discussion about how we're dealing with a major Russian military threat with armed forces that have been conditioned by 30 years of traveling through the post-Cold War era.

[3483.6–3486.98] Prime Minister: And we are where we are, with what we have.

[3487.2–3495.01] Prime Minister: And as you describe, unless NATO stands up and supports us now, we're going to feel pretty chilly pretty soon.

[3500.07–3503.76] Dr Rob Johnson: He then puts the crisis in even starker terms.

[3504.5–3511.45] Prime Minister: We want to be in a place where we're contributing to public reassurance, not public panic, and we're moving at speed.

[3511.47–3518.56] Prime Minister: To put it in another way, I can't tell you whether in 24 hours from now we are going to be at war with Russia.

[3519.22–3522.08] Prime Minister: But you and I know that we don't have a plan for this.

[3522.82–3525.93] Prime Minister: We're massively under-resourced if we stand alone without NATO.

[3527.03–3528.43] Prime Minister: And we haven't any time to fix this.

[3529.34–3530.36] Prime Minister: but we're going to have to manage it.

[3531.24–3535.51] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): CDS, I'd like you to take one message back to the cabinet, please.

[3537.57–3550.99] Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): If they think that we might have to start a fight or certainly defend against a fight, what I want to be sure of is that they have a view about how we finish this fight.

[3559.64–3562.41] Dr Rob Johnson: Coming up in episode two.

[3562.43–3563.01] Dr Rob Johnson: Good afternoon.

[3563.41–3564.75] Unknown: Good afternoon, Secretary-General.

[3565.45–3567.37] Unknown: We have suffered a number of casualties.

[3568.03–3570.81] Unknown: Russia's intention is not just Britain.

THE WARGAME - CLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT
============================================================


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[40.76–41.28] Unknown: Good to see you.

[41.72–42.54] Russian President: Hello, good to see you.

[42.62–43.58] Russian President: Thank you so much for having me.

[43.6–43.76] Unknown: Welcome.

[43.8–44.86] Unknown: You're a beautiful house.

[44.88–46.04] Russian President: Oh, a pleasure, a pleasure.

[49.25–57.61] Unknown: I've travelled to an old stone house in the middle of the English countryside to meet one of the UK's leading experts on Russia's ways of war.

[59.4–61.38] Unknown: Can you show me the security cameras that you've got here?

[62.48–65.14] Russian President: Top one's right near the house knight's nest.

[65.92–67.48] Russian President: Over here, they're all round.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[68.36–71.9] Russian President: Look down on every aspect of the house completely.

[71.92–72.77] Russian President: It's all surveyed.

[74.71–81.06] Unknown: At 78, Chris Donnelly's advice is still sought by military chiefs and government ministers.

[81.88–84.33] Unknown: But he's also on the Kremlin's radar.

[85.49–89.01] Unknown: It's why Chris takes his security very seriously.

[89.86–91.7] Unknown: How long have you had the cameras up here?

[92.24–98.53] Russian President: Well, we first put the cameras in after the house burned down in mysterious circumstances six years ago now.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[99.43–105.0] Russian President: And then 18 months ago, we had them upgraded and renewed in assistance of the police.

[106.6–116.1] Unknown: Russia's FSB spy agency twice targeted Chris in a cyber hacking campaign exposed by the UK's National Crime Agency.

[117.53–124.72] Unknown: Now, counter-terrorism police are on alert to race to his property in the event of any physical intrusion.

[126.36–128.1] Unknown: Could anyone sneak up here without you knowing?

[128.4–128.6] Russian President: Nope.

[130.78–132.89] Russian President: And as you know, we even got locked on the inside doors.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[134.59–138.41] Unknown: And do you worry that someone might try and, sort of, come and find you?

[139.17–140.31] Russian President: There's no point in worrying.

[141.05–142.56] Russian President: Do soldiers worry in wartime?

[143.18–145.92] Russian President: If you start worrying, the other side will run.

[148.58–159.27] Unknown: Chris is concerned, though, about a threat from authoritarian powers like Russia to a system of rules and values that evolved since the end of the Second World War.

[160.33–171.16] Unknown: Designed to maintain peace and security, as well as to benefit democracies, the system enshrined things like human rights, free speech and the rule of law.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[172.72–177.19] Russian President: The fact is that there are nasty people out there prepared to do very nasty things

[178.01–189.89] Russian President: and that the rules-based order which we've all complacently come to be used to and to think was permanent, because it's been guiding our life for the last 70 years, is dead and gone.

[191.31–191.95] Russian President: It's finished.

[193.81–201.71] Russian President: The institutions which were created to maintain it are rather now left drifting like ships without motors.

[204.81–211.88] Unknown: Around the end of the Cold War, Chris became a special advisor to the head of the NATO Alliance in Brussels.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[212.96–221.87] Unknown: He was one of a minority of voices who disagreed with a decision by the UK and other allies to shrink their armed forces over time.

[223.25–228.99] Unknown: Chris feared they'd be less able to defend themselves and their values if they were ever challenged.

[230.11–231.47] Unknown: It wasn't a popular view.

[237.02–242.29] Russian President: It was very easy to dismiss me and people like me as Cold War warriors and out of date.

[242.71–243.99] Russian President: Is that what people would say?

[244.09–244.63] Russian President: Absolutely.

[245.29–247.64] Russian President: They were saying that until five years ago.

[248.94–249.9] Unknown: And how does that make you feel?

[251.86–252.2] Unknown: Cross.

[257.19–261.93] Unknown: As a defence journalist, I've had the chance to get to know Chris over the years.

[262.35–268.16] Unknown: He's spent many hours sharing his concerns with me about the state of Britain's defences.

[269.22–272.17] Unknown: It's one of the reasons why I wanted to make this podcast.

[273.15–285.09] Russian President: Unfortunately, I think that our politicians have not understood, at least not until very recently, how weak the country is.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[285.62–286.93] Russian President: and how much has been lost.

[287.33–288.81] Russian President: I think they simply don't know.

[289.27–291.73] Russian President: I think they've been living with an illusion of power.

[292.83–293.78] Russian President: And that's dangerous.

[302.81–309.64] Unknown: What you're about to hear is the kind of war game that's genuinely tested inside government.

[310.97–315.62] Unknown: The main difference is that nothing discussed in this version is classified.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[358.1–374.02] Deborah Haynes: Back in central London, in a basement that's become the set of the war game, it's coffee break time.

[375.72–381.21] Unknown: The first session lasted just over an hour and the players really got into their roles.

[382.6–395.82] Unknown: This wasn't hard for most on the British side, as Jack Straw really was the Foreign Secretary, just as Amber Rudd had been the Home Secretary, and Mark Sedwell is a veteran National Security Advisor.

[397.02–406.86] Unknown: He also served as the Cabinet Secretary, the UK's top civil servant, under Prime Ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson.

[410.11–421.45] Unknown: Ben Wallace turned down the chance of running for prime minister in real life, but he was the longest serving conservative defence secretary, and before that, security minister.

[422.51–435.81] Unknown: Along a corridor in a separate underground room, also enjoying a break, is the Russian side, led by Keir Giles, an expert on the Kremlin.

[436.89–445.0] Unknown: When governments do this kind of exercise for real, Keir and his colleagues are among the people called upon to play the red team.

[445.04–455.78] Unknown: As for Rob Johnson, the Oxford academic who devised the Wargame, he's busy getting ready for what's known as the next turn.

[455.8–465.43] Unknown: While the participants talk amongst themselves, Rob keeps glancing at his pocket watch.

[466.57–473.48] Unknown: The game runs to a strict timeline and this relaxed chatter in the real world is about to end.

[478.89–480.09] Unknown: We have some breaking news.

[481.42–486.12] Unknown: Everyone retakes their seats as one of our mocked up news reports starts to play.

[487.06–490.59] Unknown: It's read by Katie Gunning, a former BBC newsreader,

[491.7–496.77] Unknown: In the war game, it's now four in the morning on Monday the 6th of October 2025.

[497.49–504.35] Unknown: Our cabinet ministers and officials have just been scrambled from their beds and into waiting cars.

[505.31–509.88] Unknown: Taken to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, they hear this on the radio.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[510.92–514.03] Unknown: Explosions have been reported across the UK.

[514.35–524.49] Unknown: Details are only just coming into us, but the emergency services say they're responding to incidents in multiple locations, including London, the south-east of England and Scotland.

[525.09–529.34] Unknown: It's not yet clear what caused the blast or whether there have been any casualties.

[530.0–534.04] Unknown: These explosions come at a time of heightened tensions with Russia.

[535.48–541.1] Unknown: Prime Minister Ben Wallace and his team assemble in what we're imagining is an emergency COBRA meeting.

[542.46–547.85] Unknown: Everyone knows they must stay professional, but this crisis is also personal.

[549.41–554.35] Unknown: Mark Sedwell, playing the National Security Advisor, or NSA, speaks first.

[555.62–559.3] Prime Minister: Can I suggest, P.M., we kick off with the latest intel?

[559.32–562.02] Prime Minister: Oh, my word.

[563.1–568.74] Unknown: Rob Johnson, in his role as chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, spells out what's going on.

[570.02–571.79] Unknown: Thank you very much, Nies.

[571.81–580.01] Unknown: At 3.15am this morning, 16 3M14 calibre missiles are launched from that Russian surface vessels that we knew of in the North Atlantic.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[580.03–585.0] Unknown: Russian Air Force with 20 attack aircraft have also launched a salvo of missiles over the North Atlantic.

[585.06–590.52] Unknown: Some 36 missiles in total were tracked in the air heading for the UK.

[590.5–605.6] Unknown: Phylindales, which provides, as you know, our ballistic missile early warning, reports that four ballistic missiles were launched from subsurface platforms in the North Atlantic and were inbound on a trajectory, as far as defence intelligence is concerned, that appeared to be in southern England.

[606.53–608.47] Unknown: That makes 40 missiles altogether.

[608.49–615.16] Unknown: The RAF scrambled, as you'd expect, from Losermouth and Connexby thanks to our high state of readiness, we ordered.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[615.78–619.58] Unknown: They've intercepted and defeated, they tell us, eight air-launched missiles.

[620.07–623.51] Unknown: That means eight missiles were shot down, but the rest got through.

[623.55–629.94] Unknown: The first missiles, using subsonic delivery speeds, arrived at 3.30 half an hour ago.

[629.96–637.17] Unknown: Finingdale's, its last message to us before it was struck, but we don't yet know the damage to that facility.

[638.82–647.43] Unknown: This is a radar station in North Yorkshire, also used by the Americans, which provides an early warning for incoming ballistic missiles.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[648.55–659.37] Unknown: Royal Navy sites were also targeted, including the nuclear submarine base at Fazlane in Scotland and the main naval base in Portsmouth as well as Heathrow Airport.

[660.33–665.44] Unknown: At 3.47 at Portsmouth and the port at Felixstowe, both were struck.

[666.14–670.25] Unknown: Missiles also arrived at Terminal 4 at Heathrow at the same time.

[670.67–675.57] Unknown: We've not yet got firm details of what the extent of the damage is, but that will be forthcoming.

[676.5–685.73] Unknown: It is anticipated that four of the unidentified but large-scale ballistic missiles will reach Portsmouth at fault 16 in 15 minutes from now.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[687.57–689.83] Unknown: Portsmouth is the home of the Royal Navy.

[691.06–702.73] Unknown: Multiple warships are typically moored alongside at a naval base there, including HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the UK's two giant aircraft carriers.

[704.54–705.8] Unknown: That concludes the intelligence brief.

[708.7–720.29] Foreign Secretary: OK, so we're now in a situation where clearly Russia has moved to a position of, effectively, an act of war against this country.

[722.9–731.41] Foreign Secretary: I think the questions for us, therefore, are first and foremost what we would call battle damage assessment, as in how much damage have the Russians inflicted.

[732.84–752.36] Foreign Secretary: Secondly, the challenge I'd like an update from is obviously how many of our military assets were remotely within range of being able to at least counter some of the launch platforms the Russians used, which would be, I'm guessing, a proportionate response should we wish to engage the actual ship or whatever that did it.

[754.19–759.58] Unknown: The Prime Minister is asking whether his forces can destroy any of the Russian fleet or warplanes.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[761.13–765.1] Foreign Secretary: And thirdly, where are we with our communications?

[765.12–767.06] Foreign Secretary: It's four in the morning, most of the country hasn't woken up.

[767.92–769.24] Foreign Secretary: I think we need to think about the time.

[769.3–771.51] Foreign Secretary: NSA, first of all.

[772.06–772.7] Prime Minister: PM, thank you.

[773.18–775.47] Prime Minister: So as you say, this is in effect an act of war.

[775.79–779.11] Prime Minister: And so we need now to proceed on that basis.

[779.87–783.32] Prime Minister: There's also some operational things that we will have to do.

[783.7–786.08] Prime Minister: Given the nature of this attack, we're going to need to disperse.

[786.66–790.41] Prime Minister: We can't have you, the defence secretary, the foreign secretary, et cetera, all in the same place.

[791.19–798.02] Prime Minister: And so we're going to need to disperse pretty quickly and continue this, at least after this meeting, on that basis.

[801.58–811.0] Unknown: Helena Kennedy, as the Attorney General, suggests invoking a suite of emergency powers to help restore order and reassure the public.

[812.06–819.93] Unknown: Prime Minister, I really do think with some urgency you have to consider the situation with regard to the Civil Contingencies Act because this is a national emergency.

[821.21–822.23] Unknown: We are under attack.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[822.97–831.51] Unknown: An act of war, an act of aggression has been committed against us and I would strongly advise that as soon as possible that you declare a state of emergency.

[835.07–838.0] Unknown: Amber Rudd as the Home Secretary supports the move.

[839.56–842.49] Dr Rob Johnson: I must agree with that because the public needs some guidance.

[842.51–850.42] Dr Rob Johnson: This is totally unprecedented.

[850.44–858.57] Unknown: I just want to stop and bring you back into the real world, because what's being described is too serious to be left only in the realms of a game.

[861.72–870.69] Unknown: This would be the gravest attack on the UK homeland since the Second World War, plunging the whole country into a state of emergency.

[871.61–874.77] Unknown: In an instant, normal everyday life would stop.

[876.54–885.25] Unknown: Schools, shops and businesses would have to shut, UK airspace would be closed and limits placed on all internal movement.

[890.66–897.61] Unknown: What you can hear are air raid sirens in Ukraine from the day Russia launched its full-scale war more than three years ago.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[897.63–912.57] Unknown: I was in Kiev at the time and watched as this European city that looked and felt so familiar transformed from a state of relative peace to one of all-out war.

[916.93–925.02] Unknown: Back in the game, the National Security Advisor is focused on the threat posed by four ballistic missiles now closing in on their targets.

[927.58–939.66] Prime Minister: CDS, these four ballistic missiles inbound, which are presumably now going to hit Portsmouth imminently, do we have any sense whether those are conventional ballistic missiles or whether they potentially have a nuclear warhead on them?

[941.5–946.5] Unknown: Richard Barons, our chief of the defence staff, or CDS, responds.

[946.87–953.26] Navy Commander: You can't tell whether a ballistic missile is conventional or nuclear until it arrives and goes bang, and then you do know.

[955.74–961.13] Prime Minister: Exactly, so we don't have any indication of what that is from intelligence or anything else, no.

[961.15–969.82] Security Analyst: Our assessment is that it's highly unlikely, since we would have known about, I think, previous deployments of nuclear systems, but at this stage we can't take anything for granted.

[971.46–978.99] Unknown: Adding to a collective sense of helplessness, the defence chief explains it's not possible to intercept these missiles.

[980.65–989.05] Navy Commander: We have almost no defence against ballistic missiles except that the Type 45 air defence has limited capability if it's in the right place.

[989.17–989.97] Navy Commander: It was in the wrong place.

[990.27–992.0] Navy Commander: It can only be in one place at once.

[993.82–1002.55] Unknown: As I mentioned in episode one, UK air defences are a major casualty of cost-saving cuts since the end of the Cold War.

[1003.89–1016.68] Unknown: The Type 45 warship is the single piece of British kit that can shoot down ballistic missiles, which are generally larger, heavier and harder to stop than cruise missiles.

[1017.78–1020.03] Foreign Secretary: We have in theory six,

[1020.28–1025.99] Foreign Secretary: We probably have in reality four of which in reality two are at sea or able to be at sea.

[1026.85–1036.23] Foreign Secretary: Certainly they are based in Portsmouth and therefore they do have a limited but capable ballistic missile defense, small as it is.

[1037.03–1039.97] Foreign Secretary: Where is the current Type 45, Sid, yes?

[1040.9–1043.28] Navy Commander: I know one Type 45 is at sea.

[1044.32–1045.66] Navy Commander: Where is it?

[1045.68–1050.39] Navy Commander: It's making its way towards the North Atlantic, up the west coast of the UK.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1052.49–1054.48] Navy Commander: I know how many missiles it has on board.

[1055.58–1058.38] Navy Commander: It has about half its full complement.

[1059.64–1063.09] Navy Commander: And that's the total number of shots that it's going to be able to fire usefully in this situation.

[1064.37–1068.37] Unknown: That means it's only carrying half the missiles it can hold.

[1070.02–1073.71] Unknown: The exact number of munitions on warships is classified.

[1074.37–1085.32] Unknown: But the fact this destroyer is only loaded with half the amount it can carry illustrates another major problem caused by a squeeze on the defence budget over many years.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1086.44–1089.42] Unknown: Insufficient stockpiles of air defence missiles.

[1091.65–1094.75] Navy Commander: The second Type 45 was tied up in Portsmouth.

[1095.21–1097.31] Navy Commander: I do not yet know whether it survived the attack.

[1098.49–1100.53] Foreign Secretary: But it's bombed up or even half bombed up?

[1101.1–1110.95] Navy Commander: It's most unlikely to have any munitions on board at all at the minute because those munitions are stored elsewhere and there was no requirement to have it bombed up.

[1111.01–1111.57] Navy Commander: It's useless.

[1113.73–1124.8] Unknown: Despite his depleted capabilities, the military chief knows his forces must respond, ideally backed up by urgent NATO reinforcements.

[1125.86–1132.47] Navy Commander: If there are more ballistic missile attacks on the UK, we have no defense against them, that the Air Force don't deal with ballistic missiles.

[1134.25–1141.68] Navy Commander: So I'm going to need some time to find out what's actually happened and what is still available to defend the UK.

[1142.0–1149.79] Navy Commander: Can I take it, Prime Minister, that you now accept that we are at war with Russia and that Article 5 of the NATO treaty has been breached?

[1149.83–1152.51] Navy Commander: Because off that is going to hang everything else that I do.

[1153.72–1160.7] Unknown: He's referring to a founding principle of the Alliance that an attack on one is an attack on all.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1160.72–1168.59] Unknown: In theory, this means a nation that's in trouble can call on its 31 allies to come to the rescue.

[1169.35–1175.77] Unknown: A powerful deterrent that's helped secure the Alliance's borders for 75 years.

[1176.37–1184.88] Unknown: But in practice, belonging to the NATO club is not the automatic guarantee of protection that many people believe.

[1186.14–1195.41] Unknown: Instead, it's merely the right to ask for help and every member of NATO needs to agree before Article 5 can be invoked.

[1196.97–1201.72] Unknown: Even then, it's up to each country to decide what assistance they will offer.

[1203.3–1204.83] Unknown: One other important point.

[1205.55–1211.15] Unknown: If NATO doesn't agree to step in, Britain's options become alarmingly slim.

[1212.25–1219.19] Unknown: Defence cuts over the years have eroded the UK's once deep arsenal of conventional forces.

[1219.23–1225.24] Unknown: In other words, all elements of military power short of nuclear weapons.

[1226.52–1231.43] Unknown: It means without NATO's help, the government could be left with two choices.

[1231.47–1241.68] Unknown: Admit defeat or order a nuclear strike, which would almost certainly prompt Moscow to fire nuclear weapons back.

[1241.66–1245.52] Unknown: An apocalyptic scenario that neither country wants.

[1247.05–1252.93] Unknown: The British team knows they must rally their NATO allies, in particular the United States.

[1259.76–1263.34] Unknown: But they're not the only ones keen for a call with Washington.

[1267.3–1271.57] Unknown: In Russia, news of the attack is being reported very differently.

[1273.25–1285.49] Russian President: The Russian Federation has this morning punished the terrorist British state for its attack against the Severomorsk naval base.

[1286.09–1291.86] Unknown: Valeriy Akhimenko, who's reading the bulletin, is an expert on Russian state communications.

[1293.12–1305.02] Unknown: He helped us craft the Russian news reports so they sound authentic, even though some of the phrases will seem strange to people not familiar with the way Russian media talks about Britain.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1305.54–1311.33] Russian President: Launched by sea and air, the Special Military Operation targeted military sites in the UK.

[1311.93–1313.35] Russian President: It was a complete success.

[1314.14–1319.91] Russian President: The world has been horrified at the hostile actions of the Anglo-Saxon regime in London for too long.

[1320.99–1331.03] Russian President: This mission will send a message to the British government to avoid direct confrontation with the Russian Federation.

[1336.11–1342.1] Unknown: Overseeing his operation from the Kremlin is the Russian President, played by Keir Giles.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1343.26–1347.82] Unknown: He heads the red team, which is pitched against the British blue team in the scenario.

[1349.38–1364.68] Unknown: Unlike in normal wargames though, our red side already knows the main moves it will make, so a key job for Keir and his team is to explain why they're attacking the UK and how Russian leaders might be thinking.

[1366.37–1367.55] Russian President: This is a historic moment.

[1368.07–1374.16] Security Adviser: I think it would be fair to say that we at this point have created a lot of chaos in Whitehall.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1375.48–1388.6] Russian President: This is our opportunity to pay back for the injustices that they have committed against us in the past and also more recently.

[1389.3–1390.38] Russian President: I think they deserve it.

[1392.64–1405.93] Unknown: As well as Keir, we have Maria Enqvist from Sweden as Russia's military spy chief, and Toms Rostok from Latvia, who's playing the head of the Russian armed forces, or chief of the general staff.

[1407.4–1409.7] Russian President: Colleagues, we see the first response from the United Kingdom.

[1410.52–1412.62] Russian President: They have declared an act of war.

[1413.76–1415.55] Dr Rob Johnson: They have finally woken up.

[1416.07–1416.93] Russian President: It would appear so.

[1417.72–1421.44] Russian President: This is what we expected, but this is still marginally symbolic.

[1421.66–1427.23] Russian President: It doesn't change facts on the ground and their military defences are weakened.

[1428.13–1429.97] Russian President: So we can proceed with further action.

[1431.81–1439.94] Unknown: Russia appears to be emboldened not just by the UK's weakened armed forces, but also its waning alliances.

[1441.31–1442.31] Russian President: I think we can assume

[1442.91–1447.44] Russian President: that the United States is going to be one of the first places that the British will call.

[1448.54–1451.0] Russian President: Therefore, I am very pleased that we called them first.

[1451.26–1451.52] Dr Rob Johnson: Yes.

[1453.28–1457.97] Dr Rob Johnson: Strategic move.

[1457.99–1468.6] Unknown: In an extraordinary move that would have been unimaginable in the Cold War, Washington has agreed to take a call from Moscow before speaking to London.

[1469.83–1471.41] Russian President: Hello, can you hear me?


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1471.49–1472.99] Russian President: Mr Secretary of State, yes we can.

[1475.29–1485.08] Unknown: Our imagined top US diplomat is played by Professor Phillips O'Brien, the head of the School of International Relations at the University of St Andrews.

[1486.53–1491.75] Unknown: He helped us craft a US position based on the principle of America First.

[1492.39–1496.04] Unknown: This underpins the current administration's foreign policy.

[1497.08–1500.84] Unknown: We can't know for sure what the US would do in real life.

[1501.62–1510.89] Unknown: But by playing the role in this way, Philips is helping us test a scenario in which Britain's allies don't immediately come to its aid.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1511.8–1515.72] Unknown: Instead, the UK has to rely on its own defences.

[1519.18–1525.03] Unknown: The US Secretary of State is available throughout the war game to speak to whoever wants to call.

[1526.46–1533.55] Russian President: Thank you for your willingness to communicate and to step forward as an honest broker to resolve the British problem.

[1534.57–1539.28] Russian President: We agree absolutely with you that we do not want a war in Europe.

[1539.38–1549.75] Russian President: And precisely for that reason, we are limiting our demonstrative actions to the United Kingdom, which, let us not forget, left Europe almost a decade ago.

[1549.73–1557.62] Russian President: Our ultimate aim is to remove the British as a problem, not just for Russia, not just for Europe, but for the United States as well.

[1557.64–1563.68] Russian President: But in order to do so, the continuing isolation of the United Kingdom is absolutely essential.

[1564.01–1570.37] Russian President: There will therefore be further measures against the United Kingdom, but not to the full extent of our capabilities.

[1571.13–1574.98] Russian President: Thank you very much for that outline of the Russian position.

[1575.43–1580.92] Russian President: We understand the Russians feel that they have been attacked by the British and the British now feel they have been attacked by the Russians.

[1581.6–1586.44] Russian President: Therefore, we believe there must be a cessation of all attacks right now.

[1587.51–1604.85] Russian President: If there are continuing attacks on the British and we determine they are coming from Russian sources, then we will have to at least leave open the possibility of providing the British with some kind of intelligence or ammunition to protect themselves from further attacks.

[1605.45–1618.97] Russian President: So we ask the Russians, please, if they can, to step back from the brink and we will keep the British and we will use all of our resources to make sure there are no further British attacks and a war in Europe is prevented.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[1620.47–1620.86] Russian President: Understood.

[1621.72–1626.92] Russian President: We have understood the importance of restraint at this point and we will proceed accordingly.

[1627.38–1629.43] Russian President: Thank you for your time, Secretary of State.

[1629.45–1629.89] Security Analyst: Thank you.

[1633.3–1641.3] Unknown: Back in London, there would be shock if the British side knew their closest ally had chosen to speak with the Russians before them.

[1641.34–1648.87] Unknown: For now, though, they're unaware this has happened and instead are preparing for their own call with Washington.

[1648.89–1654.72] Unknown: The British side also has the option to talk to the Secretary-General of NATO.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1655.34–1659.3] Unknown: You'll hear the NATO chief referred to as SecGen as well.

[1660.92–1662.7] Prime Minister: What I suggest, PM, is you do three things.

[1662.82–1665.51] Prime Minister: First is to inform them of exactly the situation that we're in.

[1666.19–1672.9] Prime Minister: If I may recommend, I think we have to say that we are therefore invoking Article 5, NATO Article 5.

[1672.94–1687.06] Prime Minister: And a decision for you is whether, essentially, to say to them, if we are on our own, we do not have much short of escalating all the way to the nuclear deterrent in order to stop this.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1688.53–1698.73] Unknown: When the National Security Advisor talks about escalating all the way to the deterrent, he means the conflict has the potential to become a nuclear war.

[1699.81–1707.99] Unknown: This is because the UK lacks the conventional forces to be able to fight back unless the US and other allies join in.

[1710.13–1713.17] Prime Minister: And if they want to stop this, then they're going to have to get engaged.

[1713.21–1717.78] Prime Minister: Because I think we have to put a bit of steel into their spines and not simply feel we can soak this up.

[1718.0–1720.32] Foreign Secretary: Who should we engage first, the US or NATO, do we think?


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1721.14–1722.2] Unknown: Personally, I think the US.

[1724.09–1730.84] Unknown: They all agree, and the face of the top American diplomat then appears via video link beamed into the Cobra Room.

[1733.03–1733.39] Foreign Secretary: Hello.

[1733.43–1735.27] Foreign Secretary: Hello, Prime Minister.

[1735.31–1740.17] Foreign Secretary: Secretary, I'm sorry to interrupt your evening, but there is something of significant concern.

[1740.67–1745.58] Foreign Secretary: In the last few minutes, missiles were launched by the Russians at the United Kingdom.

[1746.32–1750.23] Foreign Secretary: This is unprovoked act of war as we see it.

[1750.43–1753.79] Foreign Secretary: The United Kingdom will be evoking Article 5 at NATO.

[1753.81–1761.26] Foreign Secretary: And I'm very, very keen that the United States fully commit to supporting us in whatever response we do.

[1761.98–1773.0] Russian President: The position of the US, and we're still waiting to get our own intelligence to see exactly what we believe has occurred, is that we certainly do not want this to escalate anymore.

[1773.62–1782.07] Russian President: We believe that we can provide a vehicle to reach out to the Russians and try and mediate between both of you.

[1782.15–1787.82] Russian President: We have good relationships with the United Kingdom historically, but also now with the Russians.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1788.22–1790.83] Russian President: We certainly are not pleased with this Russian attack.

[1790.87–1799.12] Russian President: This was not something that we wanted, but we would like the United Kingdom now to show some restraint to step back from the edge.

[1800.02–1801.58] Russian President: And we'd also like it very clear.

[1801.86–1808.78] Russian President: We want neither side to threaten the use of nuclear weapons, let alone obviously use nuclear weapons.

[1809.61–1815.21] Russian President: Any side that does that will be considered to be acting against the interest of the United States.

[1817.1–1820.58] Unknown: The response is momentous for all the wrong reasons.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1821.66–1832.95] Unknown: Britain's security assumptions are built around a cast-iron belief that its special relationship with Washington means the US would always be there in a crisis.

[1834.04–1849.43] Unknown: A world in which that's no longer guaranteed means the risk successive governments have taken in paring back UK military strength to spend money on other priorities has left the country even more vulnerable.

[1852.05–1869.48] Unknown: Trying to appeal to their shared history, the Prime Minister reminds the Secretary of State about how the one and only time NATO has invoked Article 5 was in support of the US after the September 11th terrorist attacks in 2001.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1870.46–1873.7] Foreign Secretary: The United Kingdom were the first and foremost to come to your assistance.

[1874.6–1877.26] Foreign Secretary: We will be putting an Article 5 to NATO later.

[1878.11–1884.37] Foreign Secretary: Can you give us an indication that you will at least support our Article 5 in the NATO chamber?

[1885.07–1888.24] Foreign Secretary: Bearing in mind that Article 5 doesn't automatically mean an all-out war.

[1888.3–1892.4] Foreign Secretary: What it means is mutual support for our fellow allies.

[1894.42–1896.35] Russian President: If there are any more attacks,

[1896.71–1902.53] Russian President: launched today by the Russians, we would be inclined to support Article 5.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1903.29–1909.92] Russian President: If however, things stop now, the number one priority of the United States is to make sure there is not a war in Europe.

[1910.68–1914.03] Russian President: We are reorienting our forces much more to the Pacific.

[1915.14–1924.88] Foreign Secretary: Perhaps I would disagree that failure to support an Article 5 by the interest of the kingdom would, I'm afraid, only aid China, not the United States.

[1925.92–1935.05] Foreign Secretary: I'd like to call the president, please, of the United States as we get more information, and I'd like to communicate directly to him, please, as his ally.

[1935.99–1941.82] Russian President: If the president is willing to take those calls, that is, of course, something I would be delighted to facilitate.

[1942.31–1942.99] Foreign Secretary: Thank you very much.

[1943.15–1947.17] Foreign Secretary: We'll continue to engage through our Foreign Secretary and our National Security Advisors.

[1948.38–1949.97] Unknown: Well, that was not very encouraging.

[1950.37–1951.27] Foreign Secretary: It's an understatement.

[1951.91–1956.32] Prime Minister: So PM, I think we just need to take stock of that conversation in what you're going to say to the NATO Secretary General.

[1957.26–1965.14] Prime Minister: So clear that they're not going to come to our aid yet unless you can persuade the president otherwise, that's clearly an urgent call.

[1965.27–1969.79] Prime Minister: I think we just need to think how straightforward are we going to be with the NATO Secretary General about this.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1969.81–1975.99] Prime Minister: I think you should say that we will definitely invoke Article 5, and then we're going to have to work the phones to every European ally.

[1976.36–1978.9] Prime Minister: Otherwise, we have very few options

[1978.88–1985.17] Prime Minister: between what we have seen already and taking this all away, unless the Americans can somehow put a stop to it.

[1985.19–1987.55] Prime Minister: So I think you have to get him on side.

[1987.57–2006.66] Unknown: And you've got to persuade the Americans that given the inadequacy of our conventional capabilities, including our inability to stop ballistic missiles and so on, we may have to resort to the nuclear option.

[2007.06–2010.94] Unknown: And whether he likes it or not, if we do that, then that will involve the US.

[2012.41–2014.55] Security Adviser: That's the point I was going to make as well.

[2014.57–2017.41] Security Adviser: That's the best way to avoid what the Americans want to avoid most of all.

[2019.68–2021.88] Unknown: It's now nearing 4.30 in the morning.

[2022.96–2025.69] Unknown: The four ballistic missiles have hit Portsmouth.

[2027.75–2033.86] Unknown: People across the country are waking up in terror as news of the attack spreads.

[2034.82–2042.53] Unknown: Russia's launched a large-scale missile attack on the UK targeting multiple military sites and Heathrow Airport.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2042.69–2047.44] Unknown: At least two people have died but officials warn the toll will likely rise.

[2048.1–2054.43] Unknown: UK airspace is now closed to civilian traffic and the Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency.

[2054.87–2061.32] Unknown: The government's describing this as the most serious attack on the British mainland since the Second World War.

[2061.3–2069.2] Unknown: Details are still emerging, but Downing Street is urging the public to remain calm, stay at home and await further information.

[2070.86–2076.21] Unknown: For security reasons, the government is restricting reporting on the military sites that have been hit.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2076.91–2080.95] Unknown: We understand that RAF jets are still airborne in case of further strikes.

[2086.06–2090.64] Unknown: The Foreign Secretary, played by Jack Straw, asks for an assessment of the damage.

[2091.35–2095.24] Unknown: Do we have any indication of UK casualties, military and civilian?

[2095.32–2095.74] Unknown: We do.

[2097.08–2097.66] Foreign Secretary: We do.

[2097.86–2112.46] Foreign Secretary: Four casualties at Fylingdale, 15 at Portsmouth, two at Heathrow, nothing about Fazlaine, four Ministry of Defence police casualties and two Royal Naval personnel missing.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2113.06–2116.68] Foreign Secretary: Nothing about submarines damaged in Fazlaine that hasn't been appeared.

[2118.35–2126.49] Unknown: Rob Johnson, as chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, projects a map of the submarine base onto a large screen in the room.

[2127.49–2134.34] Unknown: This is one of the UK's most critically important sites where its nuclear-armed submarines are located.

[2135.97–2139.63] Unknown: Red circles identify the areas where the missiles struck.

[2141.2–2149.43] Unknown: — All we've got, Prime Minister, of the fleet from Defence Intelligence, has been some satellite photography of where they landed.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2149.45–2155.26] Prime Minister: — Truth is, PM, given the scale of the attack, it is remarkably and luckily light on casualties.

[2155.28–2158.42] Prime Minister: — We have no damage to the submarine fleet, Prime Minister.

[2158.44–2160.53] Prime Minister: HMS Queen Elizabeth is damaged and on fire.

[2160.55–2170.36] Unknown: — Another map appears, showing where Russian crews and ballistic missiles hit targets at the Royal Navy's main base in Portsmouth.

[2171.57–2177.64] Unknown: HMS Queen Elizabeth is a £3 billion aircraft carrier and national status symbol.

[2179.12–2183.07] Unknown: James Heapey, as Defence Secretary, lists what's been impacted.

[2184.27–2185.45] Prime Minister: Queen Elizabeth damaged on fire.

[2185.71–2188.45] Prime Minister: Type 45 HMS Diamond is damaged.

[2189.11–2196.72] Prime Minister: HMS Richmond, an anti-submarine warfare frigate, is crippled and one offshore patrol vessel has been sunk on its mooring.

[2198.68–2201.28] Unknown: This is a devastating blow for the Navy.

[2201.32–2205.43] Unknown: It's also a catastrophic moment for the whole nation.

[2206.61–2211.88] Unknown: The Prime Minister must decide on a military response, with or without NATO.

[2211.89–2221.19] Unknown: He's already asked for options to sink at least one of the Russian vessels or aircraft, but his defence chief wants to do more.

[2223.16–2226.51] Navy Commander: So there are two things that seem to me as CDS clear.

[2226.81–2232.86] Navy Commander: One is Russia has committed an act of war against the UK, and we're having the discussion about Article 5.

[2233.22–2244.62] Navy Commander: The second is it is extremely unclear that the US is going to honor its obligations, which we have benefited from and trusted for 75 years, and it's beginning to feel pretty lonely.

[2244.76–2248.12] Navy Commander: And therefore, in your conversation with the National Secretary General,

[2248.1–2254.11] Navy Commander: Quite apart from what we need to do to protect the UK, I need you to consider two big options.

[2254.19–2263.48] Navy Commander: The first is, below the nuclear threshold, the UK has national things we could do in cyberspace or by using the RAF F-35s to attack deep into Russia.

[2264.18–2268.83] Navy Commander: Are you prepared to consider unilaterally taking the fight to Russia?

[2269.94–2273.57] Unknown: He's suggesting offensive cyber attacks inside Russia.

[2273.59–2282.26] Unknown: Another option is to deploy the military's F-35 warplanes to fly what would be a high-risk bombing raid.

[2284.47–2288.95] Navy Commander: And secondly, we have to assume that Russia is going to attack again.

[2288.99–2292.72] Navy Commander: And the first wave of attacks were on the military architecture.

[2293.72–2297.76] Navy Commander: The second wave of attacks, to have any effect at all, are going to be on our daily national life.

[2297.78–2302.17] Navy Commander: They're going to be on our critical national infrastructure and the continuity of government.

[2302.19–2307.0] Navy Commander: Surely, we're approaching the point where Russia needs to understand that if it does that,

[2307.1–2312.49] Navy Commander: We are at the point of using our strategic nuclear weapon, or at least considering it.

[2312.51–2319.02] Navy Commander: Otherwise, we are just going to spend the rest of this day lying on our back with our legs in the air, taking whatever punishment we get.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2319.72–2328.21] Foreign Secretary: So I think we have to ask ourselves whether the choice of targets, predominantly Navy, that Russia has chosen,

[2328.97–2341.48] Foreign Secretary: is in Putin's mind a proportionate response to the bombing of Murmansk Harbor, the Russian Navy base, that he alleges was backed or run by British intelligence.

[2341.54–2352.65] Foreign Secretary: And his choice has been, in a sense, deliberately proportionate, we would say, of the enact a war, but nevertheless, that he is not looking to escalate.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2353.09–2357.57] Foreign Secretary: He is, in fact, looking to make a strike to make his point

[2357.55–2366.13] Foreign Secretary: and that at the same time he gets the benefit of fracturing NATO which is actually what he really wants to do at the same time and therefore

[2366.58–2387.63] Foreign Secretary: That's the question, CDS, is if we do a limited response, does that really mean we're on our backs or does it mean that we have accepted to escalate to de-escalate, but not to a point where our escalation puts us in a very dangerous spot of nuclear engagement or exchange, which is where


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2388.79–2392.61] Foreign Secretary: We have to make a difficult call of, do we think that's what he wants?

[2393.3–2397.44] Foreign Secretary: Let's be honest, neither leader will want a nuclear exchange.

[2398.18–2402.69] Foreign Secretary: Putin does not want his Moscow annihilated any more than I want London annihilated.

[2404.41–2414.41] Unknown: What the prime minister does want, though, is to put pressure on Russia in unexpected directions, such as by deploying a second nuclear-armed submarine.

[2415.47–2418.27] Unknown: He calls this kind of thing a strategic dilemma

[2419.4–2424.51] Unknown: The previous day, the prime minister told his military chief to get a second boat ready.

[2424.55–2427.29] Unknown: Now he wants it put to sea.

[2429.28–2439.33] Unknown: This is one of the strongest signals London can send to Moscow to stop its attacks, though it raises the risk of nuclear escalation by the Russian side as well.

[2441.57–2443.84] Foreign Secretary: And I think this is the biggest challenge for you, CDS.

[2443.86–2444.58] Foreign Secretary: It's important.

[2445.36–2449.28] Foreign Secretary: I would like options of a strategic dilemma to give to Putin.

[2450.02–2452.43] Foreign Secretary: At the moment, we are being responsive.

[2453.09–2459.03] Foreign Secretary: We are not being proactive in making him feel uncomfortable with a strategic dilemma.

[2459.05–2463.38] Foreign Secretary: And that's why the second boat, at the very least, gives him a dilemma.

[2463.46–2470.91] Foreign Secretary: Because he would not have done this without thinking he had some ability to curtail the boat, the nuclear bomb that we currently always have on patrol.

[2471.64–2484.1] Foreign Secretary: And the second one is, is there another part of the globe or another part of Europe we can give him a strategic dilemma where he can suffer elsewhere and therefore he has to make a different choice of what he wants to do?

[2488.5–2496.36] Unknown: Such a counter-attack requires the ability to think dynamically, and at times unconventionally, a British strength.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[2607.29–2617.39] Unknown: The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet, played by Robin Hagblom, a Finnish naval analyst, is speaking to the president via an imagined satellite phone.

[2618.43–2622.36] Unknown: He's explaining how his forces could attack Gibraltar.

[2622.61–2627.8] Unknown: We have a submarine out in the Atlantic equipped with the caliber cruise missiles we discussed earlier.

[2627.84–2637.76] Unknown: We are able to fire a major salvo with several weapons which can impact the chosen targets including the airfield and the dockyards.

[2640.6–2653.31] Unknown: At a minimum, the Russian team plans to exploit historic friction between London and Madrid over the status of Gibraltar, which shares a border with Spain, also a NATO member.

[2653.91–2658.12] Unknown: There's even a communique they plan to release at the United Nations.

[2659.01–2673.54] Russian President: I propose the following text.

[2679.85–2682.15] Unknown: The president's spy chief supports the plan.

[2682.79–2690.88] Unknown: It's in line with the Russian playbook of deploying a variety of attacks to confuse and disorientate an enemy.

[2692.16–2698.71] Dr Rob Johnson: Mr. President, I think that it will be difficult for the Spanish to resist this generous offer.

[2699.05–2699.39] Russian President: Excellent.

[2699.73–2700.09] Russian President: Very good.

[2700.13–2701.63] Russian President: We shall send those communications now.

[2701.84–2702.18] Russian President: Thank you.

[2704.96–2706.16] Russian President: Colleagues, we sit.

[2706.88–2707.98] Russian President: We wait.

[2708.08–2710.64] Russian President: We see if the British respond, and if so, how.

[2712.07–2715.79] Russian President: Again, what could they do that would impact our calculations?

[2724.06–2730.17] Unknown: At the same time in London, the Prime Minister is issuing final instructions to his defence chief.

[2731.33–2740.35] Foreign Secretary: I would like options of being able to strike at least one of the platforms that launched the attack against the United Kingdom.

[2740.59–2751.74] Foreign Secretary: So if it's a destroyer or a submarine, and we have the ability to sink one of them, to send a message that we won't go quietly, but nevertheless, again, a proportionate response to the aggressor.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2752.54–2760.95] Foreign Secretary: With total urgency, Secretary of State, I need one second boat, last line of defense, Trident at sea,

[2760.93–2772.99] Foreign Secretary: selected target directly proportional to the music, mobilisation, readiness and strategic dilemma to Russia, either here or elsewhere.

[2774.01–2776.13] Prime Minister: So, PM, can I suggest we release CDS to do that?

[2776.19–2778.09] Prime Minister: Yeah.

[2778.11–2780.47] Unknown: The chief of the defence staff leaves the room.

[2781.73–2790.38] Unknown: With Allied support more important than ever, the national security advisor prepares the prime minister to speak with the head of NATO.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2791.7–2794.74] Prime Minister: Can I just suggest there are three points you should make?

[2795.38–2805.09] Prime Minister: One is there's been an attack as you briefed the Secretary of State and we will be invoking NATO Article 5 and we need an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council this morning.

[2807.18–2813.69] Unknown: The North Atlantic Council, often referred to as the NAC, is the main decision-making body of NATO.

[2815.42–2821.97] Unknown: Each member state has an ambassador that would attend the NAC and give the view of their respective capital.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2823.45–2829.08] Prime Minister: It is now an act of aggression against the whole of NATO and that the Secretary-General needs to proceed on that basis.

[2829.8–2842.87] Prime Minister: Second, I'd suggest you dial this down a bit, but just indicate that we aren't completely confident that the United States is prepared to use armed force and they're seeking to de-escalate the situation.

[2843.91–2850.44] Prime Minister: And third, I think we do need to warn, because this will get back to the Russians, that

[2850.42–2855.85] Prime Minister: We cannot prevail in a conventional fight against the Russians on our own.

[2856.83–2860.78] Prime Minister: The CDS has some options, but we are outmatched by the Russians conventionally.

[2861.54–2873.15] Prime Minister: If the Secretary-General wants to avoid this ending up in a strategic nuclear exchange, then we need conventional options from our allies in order to be able to deter the Russians from taking this further.

[2873.17–2877.34] Prime Minister: If we're on our own, we have virtually no option other than

[2877.32–2878.78] Prime Minister: giving in or going all the way.

[2879.02–2880.74] Prime Minister: And I think it's important they understand that.

[2882.22–2886.49] Unknown: The NATO chief appears in the Cobra Room via a secure video link.

[2887.55–2888.49] Unknown: Thank you, Prime Minister.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2888.71–2893.7] Unknown: I have been up for quite a while, as I know you have, following these events.

[2896.12–2905.59] Unknown: Our NATO chief is being played by Elizabeth Brough, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and a leading expert on defence and security.

[2907.19–2917.38] Unknown: Like the US Secretary of State, she too is helping us test a scenario in which NATO allies do not immediately mobilise to defend the UK.

[2918.66–2929.36] Foreign Secretary: We have suffered a number of casualties on our military bases hit as indeed Heathrow Terminal 4 has been struck a civilian target and this is unprovoked.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2930.12–2936.71] Foreign Secretary: The United Kingdom will be triggering Article 5 and we will be very concerned

[2936.94–2939.8] Foreign Secretary: if we don't receive that support and backing.

[2940.24–2959.82] Foreign Secretary: I would simply urge, before I break off to let you obviously respond, that Russia's intention is not just Britain, it is to fracture NATO, demonstrated as weak, which will be wholly supported by China, and indeed it is therefore not in the interest of any member of NATO to not support the Article 5.

[2960.12–2967.42] Unknown: I can tell you I have also received communications from other NATO allies and indeed from our American partners.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[2968.06–2978.76] Unknown: As I think you may be aware, our American friends are not willing to agree to an Article 5 situation and that means I will not be able to call the NAC.

[2979.06–2984.62] Unknown: And I should tell you that other NATO member states, governments, have been in touch with me.

[2985.24–2989.33] Unknown: Some are willing to help the UK with surveillance.

[2989.79–2997.66] Unknown: Some, including Germany, France, and Italy, are, like the United States, predominantly concerned that this be de-escalated.

[2998.2–3004.64] Foreign Secretary: You know, this is the test of NATO as Secretary General, and it looks like we are failing at the first test.

[3005.11–3008.18] Foreign Secretary: And after this, what happens to Estonia?

[3008.52–3009.66] Foreign Secretary: What happens to Poland?

[3009.68–3011.76] Foreign Secretary: What happened to other allies?

[3012.18–3013.04] Foreign Secretary: Should we fail?

[3013.92–3024.43] Foreign Secretary: We know that Putin is banking on an international schism and a weakness of NATO, and it won't survive a failure of Article 5.

[3025.34–3030.48] Foreign Secretary: It is fundamental to what we have all stood for and invested in over decades.

[3030.66–3033.35] Unknown: Prime Minister, I regret the situation in the UK.

[3033.37–3037.65] Unknown: It's finding itself in and I support your important work within your government.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[3038.79–3039.18] Foreign Secretary: Thank you.

[3039.2–3040.18] Foreign Secretary: We'll close it there.

[3040.38–3040.7] Foreign Secretary: Thank you.

[3044.2–3050.63] Unknown: With an ever-increasing urgency to act, the Defence Chief has linked up with his top operational commander.

[3052.09–3057.8] Unknown: The Chief of Joint Operations, or CJO, is played by Lieutenant General Sir David Capewell.

[3059.13–3067.31] Unknown: The Cobra team needs options fast on how to retaliate, regardless of whether NATO stands with the UK or not.

[3068.37–3072.94] Navy Commander: CGO, I've just come from the latest meeting with Cobra.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[3074.64–3075.84] Navy Commander: A number of things have become clear.

[3075.98–3079.99] Navy Commander: The first is, no other NATO member thinks this is their fight yet.

[3080.17–3085.56] Navy Commander: Ambivalence doesn't even begin to describe the lack of warmth that this is being received by.

[3085.6–3092.13] Navy Commander: The Prime Minister accepts that we may now be at war with Russia and we may now be at war with Russia on our own.

[3092.93–3094.64] Navy Commander: He has given me the following instructions.

[3095.3–3098.82] Navy Commander: The first action is, tell me how we sink.

[3099.14–3102.71] Navy Commander: at least one Russian ship and or submarine.

[3103.67–3114.62] Navy Commander: Secondly, and the Prime Minister has not agreed to this yet, is I'd like you to tell me what options there are for conducting a conventional deep strike into Russia using the F-35 capability.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[3115.76–3121.96] Russian President: I cannot guarantee in any sense at the moment the sinking of one or two of the surface fleet.

[3122.78–3126.07] Russian President: But we can certainly begin to engineer plans to do that.

[3127.3–3130.78] Russian President: The operational fight is the more problematic area.

[3134.02–3144.46] Unknown: The commander wants to be sure his political masters understand the possibility that a British counter-attack may trigger a much bigger response from Russia.

[3145.58–3156.4] Unknown: And that raises questions about the UK's ability to sustain a protracted conflict with limited supplies unless NATO is in the fight as well.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[3157.24–3177.8] Russian President: So I'd like to understand whether or not there is appetite to take this fight to an even greater extent, which begins to beg the questions about armaments, resource, supply chains, and a much wider enablement proposition for a campaign that goes longer than two or three days.

[3178.56–3181.99] Navy Commander: So let me give you what I believe is a current position on that.

[3182.13–3185.63] Navy Commander: From the prime minister's perspective, the UK cannot

[3185.61–3197.79] Navy Commander: be seen to be completely supine in this situation and therefore it seems to me more likely than not that we may strike out the fotilla and then say that we don't intend to escalate further.

[3198.45–3209.86] Navy Commander: We know we are at a position of profound conventional disadvantage and what we're all shying away from is being a situation where the only thing left in the locker is the strategic nuclear deterrent.

[3213.15–3215.81] Navy Commander: The prime minister is very focused on this.

[3216.33–3219.22] Navy Commander: As you know, one boat at sea, the second boat will put to sea.

[3221.68–3225.47] Navy Commander: It won't be as ready as you and I would like, but it'll have some capability.

[3228.27–3230.61] Navy Commander: What happens if this becomes a protracted campaign?

[3231.8–3233.22] Navy Commander: Well, unless our allies

[3233.96–3237.7] Navy Commander: choose to fight for us, we'll find this extraordinarily difficult.

[3237.76–3239.3] Navy Commander: And I'm using understatement there.

[3240.53–3244.69] Navy Commander: But unless our allies give us their material, we're out of the game in a week.

[3247.04–3251.46] Navy Commander: So I'm struggling to find easy or attractive outcomes to this.

[3251.84–3258.18] Navy Commander: The one thing we have as a point of certainty is tell me how to sink a Russian ship in the next 30 minutes.

[3263.82–3265.53] Unknown: coming up in episode three.

THE WARGAME - CLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT
============================================================


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[43.54–44.6] Unknown: It's the job of the country.

[49.51–51.85] Unknown: Armed forces fight battles, countries fight war.

[58.24–63.47] Unknown: I'm back with Chris Donnelly, the Russia expert who we met at the start of the previous episode.

[64.51–72.06] Unknown: He was born in 1946, a year after Allied forces defeated the Nazis in the Second World War.

[73.44–76.11] Unknown: But the scars from that conflict ran deep.

[81.99–94.01] Unknown: Every one of my generation grew up in a world very heavily in the shadow of war for national survival, which had just finished and only just by the skin of our teeth been won.

[96.23–98.98] Unknown: When I was a child, food was rationed.

[99.7–103.75] Unknown: Even as I was growing up, right until the mid-50s, petrol was rationed.

[105.51–108.3] Unknown: The world was so badly damaged.

[108.32–111.24] Unknown: There had been so much destruction.

[111.28–115.83] Unknown: Everything was expensive, everything was hard to get, everything was grey.

[119.24–128.39] Unknown: As we sit in his living room, Chris explains to me how that kind of reality creates an inbuilt sense of resilience within a society.

[128.41–134.29] Unknown: That's the first place to start, and that's the most important place because it goes into your heart.

[137.0–147.89] Unknown: The second thing which goes into the brain is the logic of all the structures with which we emerged from the Second World War and converted to cope with the Cold War.

[150.57–159.64] Unknown: That, of course, included prioritising the funding and equipping of large armed forces ready to fight the then Soviet Union at any moment.

[160.85–168.38] Unknown: But it also involved maintaining a civilian population that was prepared for the worst, even nuclear war.

[169.36–173.56] Unknown: So, a very large civil defence organisation across the country.

[174.56–175.12] Deborah Haynes: What was that?

[175.24–176.12] Deborah Haynes: What did it like?

[176.56–178.84] Unknown: It took volunteers, it had uniforms.

[179.14–179.9] Unknown: What was it called?

[180.19–181.85] Unknown: A civil defence CD.

[183.29–203.5] Unknown: Its function was to mobilise in every town and village quite a large percentage of the population who would, in event of a future war, and that might well be a nuclear war, protect the population in the sense of training them to get into shelters,


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[203.8–230.26] Unknown: ...run the recovery systems... ...support the emergency services, so a massive expansion of that... ...and support law and order When the Cold War ended though... ...as well as reducing the size of its military... ...the government also chose to allow society's readiness... ...for armed conflict to fade As a nation we have lost this understanding...

[230.71–243.02] Unknown: that when bad things happen, we may have to change the whole structure, the priorities, the spending patterns of how the countries run and how our lives work.


============================================================
COMMENTARY
============================================================

[243.38–248.97] Unknown: And a shorthand for that is saying we have to be able to move from a peacetime footing to a wartime footing.

[250.13–258.04] Unknown: What would you think if you looked at the UK today from a Cold War mindset in terms of how prepared the UK is for war?

[258.5–260.6] Unknown: I wouldn't have believed it could be so bad.

[261.32–266.99] Unknown: And what do you think about the fact that there is currently no national defence plan as there was during the Cold War?

[284.22–290.05] Unknown: What you're about to hear is the kind of war game that's genuinely tested inside government

[328.57–341.11] Unknown: It was the gravest assault on Britain since the Second World War, with a barrage of missiles striking military targets across the country, as well as Terminal 4 at Heathrow Airport.

[342.91–349.77] Unknown: We left the war game with Britain's military chief telling his top operational commander to strike back.

[350.59–356.91] Prime Minister: From the Prime Minister's perspective, the UK cannot be seen to be completely supine in this situation.

[357.63–360.96] Prime Minister: Tell me how to sink a Russian ship in the next 30 minutes.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[363.42–372.4] Unknown: Sir Ben Wallace, as prime minister, is still locked in an emergency COBRA meeting with his team of real-life former ministers and military chiefs.

[373.74–377.71] Unknown: They have to figure out what to say to the nation about the attack.

[378.47–388.52] Unknown: Had the UK really come under fire, all key ministers would have been forced to disperse to different locations to avoid being wiped out in a single strike.

[389.68–398.15] Unknown: As this is a simulation though, they're staying put around a long table in a large room in the basement of a building in central London.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[399.51–404.48] Unknown: The following events take place between around five o'clock and six o'clock in the morning.

[405.22–411.05] PM (Prime Minister): What we need to work out is very simple, initial advice to public.

[411.79–413.19] PM (Prime Minister): Five points, six points, whatever.

[413.51–419.54] PM (Prime Minister): Stay at home, essential workers, report to hospitals, and prepare someone.

[419.7–421.44] PM (Prime Minister): We've got the leader of the House in touch with the Speaker.

[421.49–424.33] PM (Prime Minister): Try and bring Parliament sitting earlier.

[424.81–429.74] PM (Prime Minister): Two statements, I expect, one from Chancellor, one from the Home Secretary, if you want to lead on that.

[429.72–435.91] PM (Prime Minister): where we make very clear but in the meantime when they wake up and it's on the radio there are five or six points.

[436.19–440.94] PM (Prime Minister): We can always loosen those but let's start off so people know what to do.

[442.56–446.71] Unknown: The press secretary, played by Victoria McInnes, has a suggestion.

[447.73–453.1] President: We should also ensure Prime Minister were using the Home Office Alert System so that everybody will wake up to it on their phones, not just on the radio.

[453.12–454.36] PM (Prime Minister): So let me tell you something.

[454.38–456.24] PM (Prime Minister): I don't even know what the Home Office Alert System is.

[456.42–458.78] PM (Prime Minister): It has been probably so underused.

[458.8–459.61] PM (Prime Minister): How do we get it?

[460.01–460.91] PM (Prime Minister): Is it on the radio?

[461.29–462.21] PM (Prime Minister): Is it on the television?

[462.69–464.95] PM (Prime Minister): You get a very loud noise on your phone.

[465.07–466.5] Prime Minister: That will wake them all up, Prime Minister.

[466.51–467.44] Prime Minister: I can assure you.

[467.46–467.9] Prime Minister: Right.

[467.92–469.16] Russian President: So it wakes you up, and then what?

[473.29–481.06] Unknown: Emergency alerts are being sent to tens of millions of mobile phones across the country, letting people know the UK has been attacked.

[483.33–485.09] Unknown: This is what you would actually hear.

[485.15–492.89] Unknown: The government in the real world introduced the alert system in 2023 when they ran a nationwide test.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[493.67–495.75] Unknown: Another test is planned for this year.

[497.98–506.57] Unknown: Like air raid sirens during World War II, it would be the modern day sound of the UK at war, provided the mobile networks are still working.

[508.04–518.27] Unknown: Imagine how that would feel to be woken before dawn by this sound and a message telling you that Russia has launched missile strikes against targets across Britain.

[521.81–526.78] Deborah Haynes: We understand that RAF jets are still airborne in case of further strikes.

[526.8–530.8] Deborah Haynes: Two people have died, but officials warn the toll will likely rise.

[532.25–550.41] Unknown: The government knows it needs to do everything possible to reassure the public and prevent panic, even as it struggles to rally NATO allies to help the UK fight back.

[552.2–572.6] PM (Prime Minister): Before I address the nation, can we just make sure there are comms going out about reassurance, what we've been doing, the government has met, the government is talking to allies, just a running narrative to give people reassurance that we are active on their behalf and doing stuff and just making sure that we are listening and we are available.

[575.92–582.36] Unknown: He asks Amber Rudd, as the Home Secretary, to liaise with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments.

[583.32–594.74] Unknown: He also needs her to speak with dozens of local resilience forums that played a key role during the Covid crisis, though none have experience of responding to war.

[594.72–607.28] Prime Minister: I just want to make sure that everybody's aware the scale of the damage that's already taken place and the strain that emergency services are already under and the fact that local government do not really know what to do.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[607.62–617.08] Prime Minister: And I will speak to the Secretary of State for local government, but we do not yet have in place any guidance for the local governments about how to behave in these sorts of emergencies.

[617.46–617.98] Prime Minister: They are

[618.26–626.22] Prime Minister: at the moment, completely at sea of how to behave, what to prioritize, and we will try to put in place some of those structures for them.

[626.24–628.25] PM (Prime Minister): We used to have the war book, as they called it.

[628.69–629.79] Prime Minister: Do we still have a war book?

[629.81–630.37] Prime Minister: No, we don't.

[631.17–636.31] PM (Prime Minister): That was abandoned sometime in the 90s after the Cold War or the 2000s.

[641.87–645.29] Unknown: I'm going to step in for a moment to explain what they're talking about.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[645.34–652.52] Unknown: This is a fundamental weakness in the UK's national resilience that Chris Donnelly also highlighted.

[654.68–660.29] Unknown: Can you remember how you felt when, for example, the government war book got shelved?

[660.67–661.41] Unknown: What did I think of it?

[661.43–662.73] Unknown: I thought it was a great mistake.

[663.43–670.04] Unknown: But for the vast bulk of the political and military establishment, the tide seemed to have turned in a different direction.

[672.01–681.33] Unknown: The War Book started life around the time of the First World War as a set of national plans on what to do in the transition from peace to war.

[682.57–692.47] Unknown: It was by no means perfect because the country was once again unprepared in the run-up to the Second World War, but at least it had some kind of plan.

[693.91–705.15] Unknown: By the time NATO was established in 1949, this instruction manual to prepare for a conflict had evolved to correspond with war plans for the whole of the Alliance.

[707.17–717.54] Unknown: Marked secret and regularly updated by the Cabinet Office, the Government War Book covered so much more than just mobilising the armed forces during the Cold War.

[718.77–731.29] Unknown: It also focused on the need for local authorities, industry and wider society to be prepared for World War Three, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon.

[736.6–741.18] Unknown: But much of that readiness was allowed to fade after the Soviet Union collapsed.

[742.85–751.13] Unknown: The war book was effectively replaced by a piece of legislation you've heard the Attorney General talk about, called the Civil Contingencies Act.

[752.01–759.98] Unknown: But this law is geared far more towards responding to terrorist attacks or natural disasters, not all-out war.

[761.26–776.06] Unknown: When I asked the cabinet office about any update to a national defence plan, they simply told me, and I quote, the UK has robust plans in place for a range of potential emergencies that have been developed and tested over many years.

[777.75–778.65] Unknown: Back to the game.

[780.79–794.95] Home Secretary: Prime Minister, can I just raise that I know that obviously the major thing is security and the missile issues, but there are people who are getting out of their beds this morning and they're going to be hearing that there have been explosions in areas close to them.

[795.22–803.06] Unknown: Our Attorney General, Helena Kennedy, says people across the UK will be in a state of shock, fear and confusion.

[803.99–807.45] Home Secretary: Some of them will be heading for airports and going on their holidays or going on business trips.

[807.79–811.25] Home Secretary: Some of them will be looking for whether they should be going to their work or not.

[811.73–820.24] Home Secretary: There's going to be a lot of fear around and I just wonder about practical advice to ordinary people and I wanted to know what the Home Secretary felt she should be saying too.

[820.22–822.11] Prime Minister: Yes, thank you.

[822.51–828.28] Prime Minister: We have already announced that we've closed UK airspace and Heathrow Airport is closed as well.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[828.46–831.05] Prime Minister: So that's in place and that will be available.

[831.17–832.91] Prime Minister: Other airports, Glasgow?

[833.03–836.8] Prime Minister: Yes, because airspace is closed overall.

[836.78–847.88] Prime Minister: The local government of course do not have a rehearsal plan to respond to armed attack, but we do have structures in place as a result of the Covid situation a few years back.

[847.94–851.41] Prime Minister: So we are going to be using volunteers through the local resilience forms.

[851.81–858.38] Prime Minister: We can perhaps put that back together and we should also think about how we can use volunteers to come into

[858.36–859.58] Prime Minister: military assistance.

[859.6–864.36] Prime Minister: So we do the opposite to the military assistance, to the civilian authority camera.

[864.38–872.76] Prime Minister: It is regrettable that we haven't rehearsed this before and that we haven't been able to put it in place so local government have more information because they don't know what to do basically.

[875.74–882.33] Unknown: The National Security Advisor and Attorney General recommend invoking Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act.

[883.29–892.59] Unknown: This will give the government emergency powers to be able to do things like require people to stay at home, ban travel and ration fuel.

[892.68–906.9] PM (Prime Minister): So PM, can I suggest, you've got to make a statement to the nation and you're going to have to do that fairly shortly and you need some time to go through that because that is the crucial moment for the nation and it's going to have to be, I don't think we can go beyond 6am for that on a Monday morning.

[907.02–908.57] PM (Prime Minister): So can I suggest

[908.55–916.24] PM (Prime Minister): Assuming the attorney agrees, and I think from what she says she does, we can invoke part two of the Civil Contingency Act, which is emergency powers.

[917.04–922.98] PM (Prime Minister): We have been subject to an emergency which amounts to war or tourism, which threatens serious damage to the security of the United Kingdom.

[923.5–932.25] PM (Prime Minister): That gives ministers essentially emergency powers, and therefore to direct all emergency services to take the actions the Home Secretary set out.

[932.27–935.62] PM (Prime Minister): But it also means we can direct people to stay at home, et cetera.

[943.09–957.04] Unknown: As ministers focus on the home front, in a separate room across the corridor, the UK's top warfighting commander is asking a team of advisors for ideas on how to sink a Russian ship or submarine.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[958.25–967.27] Narrator: Could I ask you, Tom, just to put together a narrative in your own mind how we do this so there's a little bit of technical application to it as well?

[969.33–976.62] Unknown: Lieutenant General Sir David Capewell is supported by six experts in defence, security and national resilience.

[978.11–988.08] Unknown: One of them, Tom Sharp, was a commander in the Royal Navy who now works as a communications consultant.

[989.26–1009.06] Unknown: When David really was the UK's Chief of Joint Operations from 2011 until 2014, Tom worked for him at what's known as the Permanent Joint Headquarters, or PJHQ.

[1010.1–1019.24] Unknown: In the war game, we've so far largely focused on the conversations taking place in the Prime Minister's Cobra meeting, as well as at the Kremlin.

[1021.86–1035.06] Unknown: But David and his advisors have also been playing the game from the start, seated around a circular table in yet another underground room, discussing possible options and responses.

[1035.5–1041.95] Dr Rob Johnson: The issue we still have is that all three targets and SSN is the best way of prosecuting that.

[1042.37–1046.26] Unknown: The team uses a lot of military acronyms, but I'll translate.

[1047.5–1054.33] Dr Rob Johnson: Using the Cold War mentality of giving them a bloody nose underwater first up to send them scurrying back, hopefully.

[1054.72–1069.67] Dr Rob Johnson: The first order of battle is to sink one of their SSNs, maybe more if we know where they are, certainly the one that was off Scotland, using a combination of our SSN, a Type 23 frigate with Merlin and or the P8, whichever gets there first.

[1070.43–1082.68] Unknown: An SSN is an attack submarine armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes, while a frigate is a medium-sized warship that can be fitted with radars to hunt for submarines.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1083.84–1088.91] Unknown: Merlin helicopters and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft can do this as well.

[1090.09–1100.18] Unknown: What Tom's saying is that a submarine is the best way to strike back against Russia and they should aim to take out one or more of the Russian submarines.

[1100.92–1105.57] Captain: It's helpful that the one that we've seen is next door to Lossiemouth.

[1107.53–1114.1] Unknown: Sir Bernard Grey used to be the top civil servant in charge of procuring and maintaining military equipment.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1114.83–1119.99] Unknown: The place he's referring to, Lossiemouth, is on the north coast of Scotland.

[1120.33–1125.11] Unknown: It's where the UK's fleet of P-8 maritime patrol aircraft is based.

[1126.02–1135.97] Unknown: These planes are a kind of military version of a Boeing 737 airliner which he may have flown on as a passenger, but this one's armed with missiles.

[1137.25–1146.86] Unknown: Both Tom and Bernard want to target the Russian submarine that chose to surface off the Scottish coast the previous day next to a passenger ferry.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1146.96–1155.17] Captain: And therefore, from that point of view, I would be prosecuting the area with as much of P8 as we've got.

[1155.19–1163.0] Captain: Just bearing in mind it's the P8 base, our quickest remedy for the Prime Minister's point of view is finding and prosecuting.

[1163.02–1171.72] Captain: And we know it's an SSN, we know where it is, and we've got all of our ASW aircraft within 50 miles.

[1174.53–1181.46] Unknown: ASW means anti-submarine warfare, so anything that can find, track and destroy submarines.

[1182.44–1182.94] Dr Rob Johnson: That's a good point.

[1182.96–1185.01] Dr Rob Johnson: That's easily the quickest way to strike back.

[1186.21–1192.78] Unknown: Tom also suggests sending a submarine to target the flotilla of Russian warships that attacked the UK.

[1193.72–1196.43] Dr Rob Johnson: And then we can allocate one SSN to their surface fleet.

[1196.63–1198.21] Dr Rob Johnson: That is a high-risk mission.

[1198.81–1202.18] Dr Rob Johnson: But it's something that my submarine champs would very much like to get involved in.

[1202.2–1202.96] Dr Rob Johnson: I've spoken to them.

[1203.56–1208.21] Dr Rob Johnson: And in theory, if they can get in amongst that task group, they could cause merry, merry hell.

[1208.71–1213.43] Dr Rob Johnson: But it's high risk because there are still seven of their SSNs, of which one or two will be allocated to this.

[1213.71–1216.46] Dr Rob Johnson: So then it comes down to our SSN versus their SSNs.

[1217.56–1222.85] Unknown: He sets out some stark survival odds for the submariners who'd be carrying out the mission.

[1223.0–1225.67] Dr Rob Johnson: I'm sure they could get a few shots away.

[1225.69–1231.07] Dr Rob Johnson: I mean, that submarine, I would give it probably a 40% chance of not coming back.

[1235.26–1246.54] Unknown: Back in the War Games main Cobra Room, the British side has just received their first communication from the President of the United States via a post on social media.

[1246.56–1250.91] President: — He has put out a statement saying, stop the bombing on both sides.

[1251.87–1254.89] Unknown: — The Prime Minister's press secretary reads it out.

[1255.14–1261.55] President: The attacks on the United Kingdom and inside Russia this past week should never have happened, and they are sad to see.

[1262.03–1264.8] President: The United States is ready to negotiate an end to the fighting.

[1265.3–1266.72] President: My administration wants peace.

[1267.02–1268.92] President: Whoever seeks war will regret it.

[1269.38–1270.53] President: That came out about 10 minutes ago.

[1270.61–1271.59] PM (Prime Minister): OK, so not very helpful.

[1271.79–1278.04] PM (Prime Minister): Meanwhile, however, unusually, the US Navy has been ordered into the North Atlantic to conduct surveillance.

[1278.08–1284.63] PM (Prime Minister): Two carrier groups are being readied or diverted immediately to the region, so I understand, which is potentially positive news.

[1285.28–1289.93] Unknown: This could be important if they're ultimately allowed to help the UK.

[1289.99–1295.24] Unknown: American aircraft carriers are giant war-fighting platforms.

[1296.06–1303.91] Unknown: Each one will be loaded with dozens of fast jets and protected by a task force of warships and submarines.

[1308.5–1310.78] Russian President: Very interesting.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1312.44–1312.72] Russian President: Mm-hmm.

[1315.05–1320.02] Unknown: Also very alert to the movement of the American warships is the Russian team.

[1320.98–1326.09] Unknown: A weakening of US support for the UK has emboldened the Kremlin in this crisis.

[1326.91–1330.68] Unknown: But Moscow knows that Washington is not its close friend either.

[1331.32–1332.4] Unknown: Well, not yet.

[1334.24–1342.93] Unknown: The Russian president, played by Keir Giles, is asking his team for an assessment of the damage inflicted on Britain by their missile strikes.

[1344.19–1359.64] Unknown: Swedish defence expert Maria Enkvist is in the role of Russia's military spy chief, while Finnish naval analyst Robin Hagblom, speaking via video link, is pretending to be a Russian admiral and commander of the Northern Fleet.

[1360.53–1365.93] Chief of Military Intelligence: Do we see anything, Chief of Military Intelligence, from UK news reporting yet or any other sources?

[1366.75–1371.72] Russian President: Mr. President, our assessment is that the strike on Portsmouth has been successful.

[1372.94–1377.02] Russian President: UK media reports on the locations of our strikes are sparse at best.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1377.78–1381.87] Russian President: Our operators can confirm that the damage at Portsmouth is substantial.

[1382.47–1383.13] Chief of Military Intelligence: Thank you very much.

[1383.49–1385.47] Chief of Military Intelligence: Admiral, did you receive all of that?

[1385.81–1387.05] Admiral Sir Ben Key: Yes, that is understood.

[1387.11–1393.1] Admiral Sir Ben Key: My recommendation is that we will follow up the first wave with the second wave targeting the capabilities left.

[1394.18–1394.5] Chief of Military Intelligence: Thank you.

[1394.64–1395.85] Chief of Military Intelligence: We will proceed as scheduled.

[1396.72–1402.29] Unknown: The Russian attack isn't just being fought by warships, jets and submarines, though.

[1403.29–1409.38] Unknown: The Kremlin is also using information as a weapon to undermine and isolate the UK.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1410.44–1416.29] Unknown: The president asks his spy chief for an update on what he calls information warfare measures.

[1417.12–1422.48] Chief of Military Intelligence: Please brief me on the information warfare measures that your services have prepared against the United Kingdom.

[1423.24–1424.71] Russian President: Yes, Mr President.

[1425.02–1428.69] Russian President: We have prepared two options here to direct the narrative.

[1429.41–1434.05] Russian President: The first is how dare the UK media blame Russia for this.

[1435.05–1439.7] Russian President: We will frame it as being all rosophobia by the aggressive British government.

[1440.94–1450.39] Russian President: And the second one, if it really is Russia, it has indeed been provoked by the UK, which must now back down from supporting Ukraine most of all.

[1452.04–1461.51] Russian President: Also, one of our agents is already out on the BBC saying that this is a result of the UK's provocation of Russia over the years.

[1463.28–1469.22] Unknown: The spreading of multiple conflicting lies is a classic form of Russian disinformation.

[1470.41–1477.21] Unknown: It was used to try to cast doubt on British evidence that Russia carried out the Salisbury spy poisonings in 2018.

[1478.56–1480.7] Unknown: Moscow has always denied involvement.

[1481.44–1488.33] Unknown: The Kremlin also deployed the same kind of tactic to justify its full-scale war in Ukraine.

[1488.31–1499.8] Unknown: Vladimir Putin denied up until the last moment that he had any plans to launch an attack, even as more than 100,000 Russian troops massed along Ukraine's border.

[1500.08–1516.78] Unknown: On the 18th February 2022, the Russian leader told a news conference his soldiers are just on a defensive exercise and wouldn't threaten anyone.

[1517.92–1520.12] Unknown: Six days later, they invaded.

[1582.53–1583.95] Narrator: Eligibility conditions apply.

[1583.99–1598.92] Unknown: The Russian disinformation creates yet another battlefield for the UK, one that it has to fight across social media platforms as well as more traditional news sites.

[1600.13–1606.49] President: So we've got kind of agents of influence are putting out that this is an appropriate response to British imperialism.

[1606.55–1611.62] President: So that's something that we need to be aware of is now very openly in the global media.

[1612.42–1616.89] Unknown: Back in the Cobra meeting, the press secretary is briefing the British team.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[1617.18–1623.85] President: The other point to make is that it has now been over an hour since the first strikes landed, and we have not made any public response.

[1624.27–1628.28] President: We need to consider that in terms of the priorities and actions and timing now to provide reassurance.

[1629.06–1638.27] Unknown: She wants the prime minister to broadcast his address to the nation as soon as possible so his words can push back hard against the Russian claims.

[1639.69–1643.56] Unknown: The national security adviser, played by Mark Sedwell, agrees.

[1644.58–1649.25] PM (Prime Minister): Can I just urge colleagues, we're going to get a lot of updates and a lot of noise from the Russians here.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1650.22–1656.77] PM (Prime Minister): Unless it's central, let's take that out of the room PM and not allow you and your senior colleagues to be distracted.

[1658.13–1665.65] Unknown: General Sir Richard Barons, the Defence Chief, wants to update the Prime Minister on options to attack the Russian Navy.

[1665.8–1667.38] Prime Minister: I have two urgent issues.

[1667.68–1679.01] Prime Minister: The chief of joint operations has made the very good point that any strike that we now make on that Russian fertility relies on the strategic enablement that we get from other people's satellites and communications networks.

[1679.62–1682.46] Prime Minister: So far, those have not been denied to us.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1682.52–1688.87] Prime Minister: But in ministers communications with their counterparts, even if they're not going to fight for us, they must keep giving us access.

[1689.84–1694.41] Unknown: All modern armed forces rely heavily on what's known as enablers.

[1695.17–1698.72] Unknown: You can't just send tanks, jets and warships to fight.

[1699.38–1704.53] Unknown: They need data and other forms of intelligence to be able to find and hit targets.

[1705.39–1708.43] Unknown: They also need to be able to refuel and to rearm.

[1709.65–1719.01] Unknown: NATO allies rely in large part on the US for many of these enablers because America has by far the biggest military.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1719.19–1743.1] PM (Prime Minister): Without this kind of US support... ...things could become even more difficult for the UK Would it be the case that in the next 10 minutes... ...we've readied and fired a torpedo... ...that it would still be able to function now in this moment... ...without ringing up and asking in advance... ...if we were just to simply use a certain or a storm shadow, for example... ...that we would be able to do that?

[1743.12–1746.66] Prime Minister: We need the satellite communication in order to make sure... ...we know where the targets are

[1747.44–1749.96] Unknown: the National Security Advisor offers a view.

[1750.56–1753.08] PM (Prime Minister): But CGS, we have that at the moment, don't we?

[1753.2–1753.7] PM (Prime Minister): We do.

[1753.72–1758.83] PM (Prime Minister): So I would caution against asking in case they switch it off.

[1759.13–1773.23] Prime Minister: I communicate in real time, so if they're going to switch it off, they switch it off after we've... So I think this is all linked to the CGO's second question, which is, once we have... and we are likely to have sunk a Russian ship in the next 30 minutes.

[1773.25–1774.61] Prime Minister: Once we have done that,

[1774.88–1775.8] Prime Minister: What's the next play?

[1776.18–1779.16] Prime Minister: Is there a day march to say, that's it, if you want to stop, we want to stop?

[1779.68–1797.63] Prime Minister: Because if we fail to deescalate this, and my own view is that is more likely, and we're into a long haul, then the finite number on our missiles able to shoot down other people's missiles, the limitations on the strategic enablement we get from common architecture, all of that is going to come.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[1797.81–1803.63] Prime Minister: We need our allies to send us their stuff, or we're out of the game within a week.

[1804.54–1808.57] Unknown: The UK doesn't just have limited capabilities to defend itself.

[1809.19–1810.83] Unknown: It also lacks capacity.

[1811.73–1815.96] Unknown: That's not just a question of the number of jets or air defence systems.

[1816.62–1819.12] Unknown: It's also about how well they're armed.

[1820.16–1828.04] Unknown: Like so many parts of the armed forces, stockpiles of ammunition have been reduced over time to save money.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[1829.05–1838.87] Unknown: The military has also given a lot of its remaining weapons to Ukraine without receiving enough cash from the Treasury to replenish its own stocks at speed.

[1840.28–1846.56] Unknown: Adding to the problem, the UK has far fewer arms factories than it did in the Cold War.

[1847.5–1851.57] Unknown: Production lines are starting to expand again, but slowly.

[1852.77–1856.03] Prime Minister: After you've had about seven of those attacks roughly, I'll be out of missiles.

[1856.53–1861.97] Prime Minister: So if our allies are not going to come to our defence, and they don't appear to be, they could at least send us their missiles.

[1862.91–1867.49] Unknown: The Prime Minister wants to prioritise fighting over fretting about stockpiles.

[1868.4–1879.27] PM (Prime Minister): Our ammo stocks, woefully low as they are, should not preclude us from taking action because keeping them from a rainy day isn't going to help anyone already in a rainy day.

[1880.01–1883.18] PM (Prime Minister): So then I think we should take that choice.

[1883.38–1886.0] PM (Prime Minister): The Secretary of State for Defence is authorising a chain of command.

[1886.74–1891.59] PM (Prime Minister): Then afterwards we can see what happens with our allies and friends.

[1892.24–1902.01] Unknown: He says the UK must send a clear message after it sinks a Russian ship that this was a proportionate act of self-defence following Russia's attack.

[1903.23–1910.86] PM (Prime Minister): That in itself is a clue to the Russians that there is a potential here for a limitation for a barrier.

[1911.5–1918.13] PM (Prime Minister): If at the same time they don't want to take that decision, then we'll readdress it then.

[1918.77–1928.24] Unknown: The defence secretary, played by James Heapey, is worried about the timing of a decision to sink the ship, given the risk of a Russian retaliation.

[1929.02–1943.24] Foreign Secretary: I'm concerned that the sequencing of your address to the nation versus the military opportunity to respond means that we could find that this situation starts to escalate in a rather uncontrolled way quite quickly.

[1943.66–1947.11] Foreign Secretary: And I think therefore it is important for you to be clear

[1947.09–1954.26] Foreign Secretary: Do you wish to make your address donation with all of the messaging that that brings internationally prior to taking any decision?

[1954.73–1962.51] Foreign Secretary: Or do you want to prioritize taking the military decision at the moment that is expedient, even if that were to come before you have addressed the nation?

[1962.53–1965.11] Foreign Secretary: That's, I think, the key question for you.

[1965.37–1969.19] PM (Prime Minister): Well, I think, first of all, does anyone here believe we should not

[1969.17–1977.41] PM (Prime Minister): No matter when it comes, we should not take a limited self-defence strike against the Russian asset.

[1978.51–1983.21] Foreign Secretary: No, but one must think of what that action will be.

[1983.73–1987.04] Foreign Secretary: We're asking one UK military asset to strike a Russian.

[1987.06–1989.16] Foreign Secretary: The Russian asset may well respond.

[1989.6–1997.67] Foreign Secretary: And I'm just... I don't think that you should assume that it will be taken as a single, measured, discrete act.

[1998.17–1999.95] Foreign Secretary: It may well trigger a response.

[2000.27–2001.11] Foreign Secretary: That is the risk.

[2001.37–2001.75] Foreign Secretary: Exactly.

[2001.77–2006.86] Russian President: I totally get that.

[2007.55–2019.77] Russian President: I'm hesitant, not to say reluctant, to see us use this so-called window of opportunity to attack a single Russian asset.


============================================================
RED
============================================================

[2020.61–2025.52] Russian President: Because I think it will put us on the back foot in a way that diplomatically we're not at the moment.

[2025.58–2028.22] Russian President: We have the option of doing this

[2028.47–2029.62] Russian President: as it were, down the line.

[2030.34–2039.45] Russian President: And to come to the point that CDS and the defense secretary and the NSA advisor have also made, there's a question of, what do we do next?

[2040.11–2042.67] Russian President: And so we attack this Russian asset.

[2043.17–2044.16] Russian President: We sink a Russian boat.

[2044.98–2046.76] Russian President: They're not going to sit on that.

[2046.8–2048.36] Russian President: They have more assets than we do.

[2048.8–2052.67] Russian President: And they don't rely on other nations in the way that we do for our capability.

[2052.97–2054.07] Russian President: So they then do something else.

[2054.95–2056.03] Russian President: What do we do again?

[2056.43–2058.62] PM (Prime Minister): But what do we know about Putin's track record?

[2058.72–2063.26] PM (Prime Minister): That if we don't do anything, Putin's track record is usually to continue.

[2064.14–2065.15] Russian President: Yeah, I accept that.

[2065.45–2066.03] PM (Prime Minister): Would you say that?

[2066.05–2068.19] PM (Prime Minister): I think that's absolutely correct, Prime Minister.

[2069.01–2070.13] PM (Prime Minister): I don't think you should rush this.

[2070.35–2080.38] PM (Prime Minister): We've got a nation out there that is waking up that has heard explosions, has seen this nation under attack for the first time since 1940.

[2080.67–2087.03] PM (Prime Minister): and you want to just take a breath before you decide exactly what the next move is.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2093.28–2097.8] Unknown: As they're talking, the Defence Chief is handed a piece of official-looking paper.

[2099.12–2106.65] Unknown: This new information, known in wargame language as an inject, has been issued by Rob Johnson, the Games Master.

[2107.75–2110.14] Unknown: The Chief of the Defence Staff reads it out,

[2111.21–2112.68] Prime Minister: I'm sorry, I have to interrupt.

[2113.6–2118.15] Prime Minister: I have to report that we have sunk a Russian ship in self-defense.

[2118.71–2125.37] Prime Minister: One of our submarines in proximity to the Russian fertility was attacked and it has sunk a Russian ship.

[2125.94–2127.8] Prime Minister: What was the ship that was sunk?

[2128.09–2135.51] Prime Minister: The Russian vessel so unfairly victimised by a British submarine was the Vice Admiral Kulikov, which is a Hudile class destroyer.

[2135.84–2137.32] Prime Minister: So a valuable target.

[2137.64–2140.24] PM (Prime Minister): So look, I think what we do is we cash that in the bank.

[2140.42–2144.39] PM (Prime Minister): We say that we took, we defended ourselves.

[2145.51–2154.4] PM (Prime Minister): And indeed, if there is any communications on that ship or any witnesses on that ship, we make sure that is in the public arena.

[2156.13–2161.06] Unknown: This is a significant development, the sudden sinking of a Russian warship.

[2162.32–2172.83] Unknown: As you know, a British submarine had been tasked with trying to attack the Russian flotilla, but while on this mission it was threatened and opened fire in self-defence.

[2174.17–2181.94] Unknown: A destroyer like the Vice Admiral Kulakov would probably have a crew of more than 220 sailors.

[2181.92–2192.96] Unknown: Russia's navy has lost a lot of vessels in its war against Ukraine… …but this is the first time the Royal Navy… …has directly sunk a Russian warship in more than a century.

[2194.08–2196.48] Chief of Military Intelligence: We just lost the ship.

[2196.5–2198.38] Chief of Military Intelligence: I see there has been a development.

[2198.61–2198.89] Russian President: Yes.

[2201.37–2204.79] Unknown: It's unexpected and unwelcome news for the Russians.

[2205.64–2209.56] Chief of Military Intelligence: I would like now to speak to the commander of the Northern Fleet… …if he is on the line.

[2210.08–2212.11] Admiral Sir Ben Key: Yes, the Commander of the Northern Fleet is here.

[2212.59–2215.05] Chief of Military Intelligence: Admiral, we understand that one of your vessels has been sunk.

[2215.68–2222.35] Admiral Sir Ben Key: Yes, we have unfortunately seen one of our large anti-submarine ships being sunk by a torpedo.

[2223.03–2237.07] Admiral Sir Ben Key: Immediately upon this happening we have launched additional anti-submarine helicopters who will start looking for any signs of the submarine trying to follow us and in the best case we hope to be able to identify its location and seek it.

[2237.9–2240.56] Admiral Sir Ben Key: Unfortunately this is the kind of losses one can expect.

[2241.27–2241.89] Chief of Military Intelligence: Absolutely.

[2242.01–2252.78] Chief of Military Intelligence: I am sure you will be doing your best to recover whatever survivors you can, but I'm sure we are also all agreed that this is an entirely acceptable price to pay for the success of our operations so far.

[2253.26–2254.16] Chief of Military Intelligence: Does anybody disagree?

[2254.6–2257.63] Russian President: No.

[2257.65–2263.71] Unknown: The Russians then start to question whether the Americans may have helped the British attack their ship.

[2264.12–2269.24] Admiral Sir Ben Key: We cannot rule out that US intelligence has been aiding in the targeting of our vessels.

[2269.72–2278.64] Admiral Sir Ben Key: We are currently looking into that, as well as going once more through all the sonar contacts we have to make sure that there isn't a US submarine shadowing our squadron.

[2279.92–2280.3] Chief of Military Intelligence: Very good.

[2280.42–2280.76] Chief of Military Intelligence: Thank you.

[2280.78–2281.43] Chief of Military Intelligence: Keep us informed.

[2283.85–2287.8] Chief of Military Intelligence: So, at present, we have suffered damage.

[2288.09–2290.94] Chief of Military Intelligence: but nothing significant enough to change our course.

[2291.78–2294.18] Chief of Military Intelligence: Our only real concern is the attitude of the United States.

[2295.79–2297.07] Foreign Secretary: Yeah, less than expected.

[2297.23–2298.21] Russian President: Yes.

[2298.23–2304.64] Russian President: It will be interesting to see whether the US have actively assisted the Anglo-Saxons or not.

[2305.64–2309.13] Chief of Military Intelligence: I suspect we may not have a clear answer to that from the Americans.

[2309.15–2310.67] Russian President: It is something that we need to handle.

[2312.61–2316.72] Unknown: Tom's Rostocks, playing the part of Russia's military chief, offers a view.

[2317.37–2325.8] Foreign Secretary: This was probably implied when the state secretary said that the US would pursue an even-handed approach.

[2326.47–2327.89] Russian President: It is fair to assume that, yes.

[2328.85–2337.42] Unknown: The admiral suggests asking the Americans to help them sink the British submarine that fired the missile if they really are being even-handed.

[2338.42–2339.18] Unknown: We can always ask.

[2339.22–2340.65] Chief of Military Intelligence: That is an excellent question.

[2341.69–2352.2] Unknown: In London, the Prime Minister also wants to speak to the Americans, as the President had warned in his social media post that whoever seeks war will regret it.

[2353.09–2357.35] PM (Prime Minister): And if you remember, his last word on his tweet is, I think they will pay.

[2357.41–2360.29] PM (Prime Minister): Wasn't that the line on his tweet?

[2360.31–2360.84] PM (Prime Minister): It was, yes.

[2360.86–2361.07] PM (Prime Minister): It was.

[2361.09–2367.34] PM (Prime Minister): So, I think we need to go straight back to the United States and remind them that the Russians have, in a sense, done that.

[2368.13–2373.14] Unknown: He's referring to the fact the British submarine had been acting in self-defence.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2374.82–2382.05] PM (Prime Minister): OK, very briefly, as this is sort of hot and live, there are other things we have to also consider.

[2382.47–2393.14] PM (Prime Minister): So our economy, Chancellor, with some urgency, whatever work we need to do to make sure that the economy, when the markets open, etc., we are protected.

[2394.56–2396.94] Unknown: Our Chancellor is played by Jim Murphy.

[2396.98–2412.22] Unknown: In real life, he served as Secretary of State for Scotland in Gordon Brown's government, then as Shadow Defence Secretary in Opposition, before becoming leader of the Scottish Labour Party between 2014 and 2015.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2412.36–2422.19] Unknown: In the war game, the Chancellor flew back the previous night from a trip to China, so this is the first time we're hearing from him.

[2423.89–2430.88] PM (Prime Minister): It might sound trivial to some people in the middle of an attack, but fundamentally our economy is absolutely one of the things Russia would be after.

[2431.18–2433.68] PM (Prime Minister): You're going to have to think, Chancellor, about whether you're going to let the markets open.

[2433.7–2434.62] Chancellor: Of course.

[2434.66–2444.8] Chancellor: If this is a one-off event, then even what we've seen already today will have very deep and long-term impacts on our economy.


============================================================
EXPLANATION
============================================================

[2444.78–2450.47] Chancellor: But if it's more significant than that, then we're an entirely uncharted territory in any of our lives.

[2450.49–2453.69] Chancellor: And we have to build an economic response that matches that.

[2453.73–2459.08] Chancellor: So I've got the Bank of England governor out of his bed, I've spoken to him two or three times about monetary policy.

[2459.8–2467.19] Chancellor: On the opening of the market, the stock exchange, from memory it's only closed in September 1939, even on 9-11 it stayed open.

[2467.17–2473.93] Chancellor: I want to talk to the US Treasury Secretary and others before coming to a view as to whether the market should open.

[2474.41–2483.86] Chancellor: And finally, this may be the last time I have a chance to speak to you before you address the nation, so I just wanted to implore upon you that we take a posture of peace through strength.


============================================================
BLUE
============================================================

[2483.84–2489.33] Chancellor: If we are too weak in the next hour, this ends with our humiliation and surrender.

[2490.39–2497.3] Chancellor: And I stand alongside you and behind you and taking whichever measures are required to get us through this day and through these events.

[2498.97–2501.63] Unknown: A civil servant then hands the Prime Minister a note.

[2502.63–2506.16] PM (Prime Minister): The latest flash signal we've had, I've just received,

[2506.64–2510.97] PM (Prime Minister): It says that Russia's nuclear arsenals are being placed on the highest state of alert.

[2510.99–2515.38] PM (Prime Minister): So what we need to make sure is we go back again to the United States.

[2515.4–2524.33] Unknown: The UK is wondering whether this nuclear escalation by Moscow could prompt the US finally to take Britain's side.

[2524.65–2527.35] PM (Prime Minister): So, Prime Minister, it's now just after six.

[2527.39–2529.78] PM (Prime Minister): You were due to address the nation just a few minutes ago.

[2529.82–2534.94] PM (Prime Minister): While you are prepping and doing that, the Foreign Secretary can get us on the line to the US Secretary of State.

[2534.96–2536.42] PM (Prime Minister): He's apparently ready to speak to us again.

[2536.88–2543.35] PM (Prime Minister): I really think you need to go and do that now and have a quick glance at your speech.

[2543.37–2554.4] Unknown: The National Security Advisor is preparing his boss for what will be the most significant public broadcast by any British Prime Minister since the Second World War.

[2554.75–2558.9] PM (Prime Minister): Am I actually going to do it?

[2558.92–2561.48] Unknown: Ben Wallace leaves the room with his press secretary.

[2561.52–2565.78] Unknown: They head down the corridor and into a small radio studio.

[2565.82–2567.63] Russian President: Take a seat just there.

[2570.07–2570.31] Unknown: Right, okay.

[2570.33–2577.5] Unknown: His team has already worked up a draft speech, but ultimately it's up to the Prime Minister to decide what to say.

[2577.56–2580.88] Unknown: He makes his own handwritten changes.

[2582.7–2592.07] PM (Prime Minister): Russian missiles have impacted our brave emergency services.

[2592.91–2594.29] PM (Prime Minister): I've deployed to the scenes.

[2595.68–2599.82] PM (Prime Minister): We are appealing for those of you in the areas affected by the missile attacks to remain in place and to listen to news.

[2599.86–2604.61] PM (Prime Minister): It's important that you will be safe and easy to look after if you remain at home.

[2604.65–2605.19] PM (Prime Minister): So stay at home.

[2605.23–2606.03] PM (Prime Minister): That's the first thing you do.

[2606.05–2606.57] PM (Prime Minister): Stay at home.

[2606.61–2607.57] PM (Prime Minister): Hide them on the table basically.

[2608.75–2609.27] PM (Prime Minister): Stay at home.

[2609.91–2612.11] PM (Prime Minister): Further advice will be

[2613.58–2639.08] Unknown: It's now just gone six in the morning on Monday the 6th of October 2025.

[2640.53–2641.01] PM (Prime Minister): Good morning.

[2641.69–2645.72] PM (Prime Minister): In the early hours of this morning, this country came under armed attack by Russia.

[2646.54–2651.79] PM (Prime Minister): This attack was unprovoked, illegal under international law, and utterly unnecessary.

[2656.6–2660.87] PM (Prime Minister): So, Foreign Secretary, can I suggest you take the PM's chair just for now?

[2661.22–2674.8] Unknown: As the Prime Minister speaks, Jack Straw, as Foreign Secretary, moves into his seat at the head of the table in the Cobra Room for a call with the US Secretary of State, played by Phillips O'Brien.

[2705.92–2709.19] Russian President: There is a completely false assumption in what you've said.

[2709.45–2718.0] Russian President: We were not remotely responsible for the attack on the naval base of the Russian Federation that has triggered all this.

[2718.96–2723.32] Russian President: I do not understand why in those circumstances

[2796.95–2803.42] Unknown: Well, the US submarine would not have been caught in this kind of situation and let a Russian get close enough to attack it.

[2835.71–2845.38] PM (Prime Minister): The situation, I know, is very alarming, but our country has endured many attacks in the past, and I ask each of you to consider how you may assist in this moment of national trial.

[2856.75–2861.93] Unknown: We do not see any other European state at this point fearing that a war is about to break out.

[2862.42–2866.64] Unknown: So that is why we would like to handle this bilaterally with the British and the Russians.

[2867.26–2873.83] Unknown: We are going to follow the US policy as laid out by the president, which will look after American interests first.

[2907.26–2916.25] Chief of Military Intelligence: The Americans tell us that they believe both sides are now involved in a tit-for-tat exchange which is heading in the wrong direction, and they are urging both to stop all military operations aimed at the other.

[2916.96–2926.73] Chief of Military Intelligence: I believe we need to continue with our sozzet, with our strategic operation for the destruction of critically important targets precisely for the purpose of coercion to peace.

[2927.69–2928.15] Foreign Secretary: I agree.

[2929.45–2933.06] Foreign Secretary: And we don't have that much time left.

[2934.12–2937.49] Russian President: Yes, it is time to strike while we still can.

[2948.04–2953.73] Foreign Secretary: I'm not clear what can be done to warn civilian populations who are in mortal danger.
