The local government of course do not have a rehearsal plan to respond to armed attack, but we do have structures in place as a result of the Covid situation a few years back. So we are going to be using volunteers through the local resilience forms. We can perhaps put that back together and we should also think about how we can use volunteers to come into military assistance. So we do the opposite to the military assistance, to the civilian authority camera. It is regrettable that we haven't rehearsed this before and that we haven't been able to put it in place so local government have more information because they don't know what to do basically. The National Security Advisor and Attorney General recommend invoking Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act. This will give the government emergency powers to be able to do things like require people to stay at home, ban travel and ration fuel. So PM, can I suggest, you've got to make a statement to the nation and you're going to have to do that fairly shortly and you need some time to go through that because that is the crucial moment for the nation and it's going to have to be, I don't think we can go beyond 6am for that on a Monday morning. So can I suggest Assuming the attorney agrees, and I think from what she says she does, we can invoke part two of the Civil Contingency Act, which is emergency powers. We have been subject to an emergency which amounts to war or tourism, which threatens serious damage to the security of the United Kingdom. That gives ministers essentially emergency powers, and therefore to direct all emergency services to take the actions the Home Secretary set out.

Just bearing in mind it's the P8 base, our quickest remedy for the Prime Minister's point of view is finding and prosecuting. And we know it's an SSN, we know where it is, and we've got all of our ASW aircraft within 50 miles. ASW means anti-submarine warfare, so anything that can find, track and destroy submarines. That's a good point. That's easily the quickest way to strike back. Tom also suggests sending a submarine to target the flotilla of Russian warships that attacked the UK. And then we can allocate one SSN to their surface fleet. That is a high-risk mission. But it's something that my submarine champs would very much like to get involved in. I've spoken to them. And in theory, if they can get in amongst that task group, they could cause merry, merry hell. But it's high risk because there are still seven of their SSNs, of which one or two will be allocated to this. So then it comes down to our SSN versus their SSNs. He sets out some stark survival odds for the submariners who'd be carrying out the mission. I'm sure they could get a few shots away. I mean, that submarine, I would give it probably a 40% chance of not coming back. Back in the War Games main Cobra Room, the British side has just received their first communication from the President of the United States via a post on social media. — He has put out a statement saying, stop the bombing on both sides. — The Prime Minister's press secretary reads it out. The attacks on the United Kingdom and inside Russia this past week should never have happened, and they are sad to see. The United States is ready to negotiate an end to the fighting. My administration wants peace. Whoever seeks war will regret it. That came out about 10 minutes ago. OK, so not very helpful. Meanwhile, however, unusually, the US Navy has been ordered into the North Atlantic to conduct surveillance. Two carrier groups are being readied or diverted immediately to the region, so I understand, which is potentially positive news. This could be important if they're ultimately allowed to help the UK. American aircraft carriers are giant war-fighting platforms. Each one will be loaded with dozens of fast jets and protected by a task force of warships and submarines. Very interesting.",

So if our allies are not going to come to our defence, and they don't appear to be, they could at least send us their missiles. The Prime Minister wants to prioritise fighting over fretting about stockpiles.

That in itself is a clue to the Russians that there is a potential here for a limitation for a barrier. If at the same time they don't want to take that decision, then we'll readdress it then. The defence secretary, played by James Heapey, is worried about the timing of a decision to sink the ship, given the risk of a Russian retaliation. I'm concerned that the sequencing of your address to the nation versus the military opportunity to respond means that we could find that this situation starts to escalate in a rather uncontrolled way quite quickly.

Or do you want to prioritize taking the military decision at the moment that is expedient, even if that were to come before you have addressed the nation? That's, I think, the key question for you. Well, I think, first of all, does anyone here believe we should not No matter when it comes, we should not take a limited self-defence strike against the Russian asset. No, but one must think of what that action will be. We're asking one UK military asset to strike a Russian. The Russian asset may well respond. And I'm just... I don't think that you should assume that it will be taken as a single, measured, discrete act. It may well trigger a response. That is the risk. Exactly. I totally get that.

This new information, known in wargame language as an inject, has been issued by Rob Johnson, the Games Master. The Chief of the Defence Staff reads it out, I'm sorry, I have to interrupt. I have to report that we have sunk a Russian ship in self-defense. One of our submarines in proximity to the Russian fertility was attacked and it has sunk a Russian ship. What was the ship that was sunk? The Russian vessel so unfairly victimised by a British submarine was the Vice Admiral Kulikov, which is a Hudile class destroyer. So a valuable target. So look, I think what we do is we cash that in the bank. We say that we took, we defended ourselves. And indeed, if there is any communications on that ship or any witnesses on that ship, we make sure that is in the public arena. This is a significant development, the sudden sinking of a Russian warship. As you know, a British submarine had been tasked with trying to attack the Russian flotilla, but while on this mission it was threatened and opened fire in self-defence. A destroyer like the Vice Admiral Kulakov would probably have a crew of more than 220 sailors. Russia's navy has lost a lot of vessels in its war against Ukraine… …but this is the first time the Royal Navy… …has directly sunk a Russian warship in more than a century. We just lost the ship. I see there has been a development. Yes. It's unexpected and unwelcome news for the Russians. I would like now to speak to the commander of the Northern Fleet… …if he is on the line. Yes, the Commander of the Northern Fleet is here. Admiral, we understand that one of your vessels has been sunk. Yes, we have unfortunately seen one of our large anti-submarine ships being sunk by a torpedo. Immediately upon this happening we have launched additional anti-submarine helicopters who will start looking for any signs of the submarine trying to follow us and in the best case we hope to be able to identify its location and seek it. Unfortunately this is the kind of losses one can expect. Absolutely. I am sure you will be doing your best to recover whatever survivors you can, but I'm sure we are also all agreed that this is an entirely acceptable price to pay for the success of our operations so far. Does anybody disagree? No. The Russians then start to question whether the Americans may have helped the British attack their ship. We cannot rule out that US intelligence has been aiding in the targeting of our vessels. We are currently looking into that, as well as going once more through all the sonar contacts we have to make sure that there isn't a US submarine shadowing our squadron. Very good. Thank you. Keep us informed. So, at present, we have suffered damage. but nothing significant enough to change our course. Our only real concern is the attitude of the United States. Yeah, less than expected. Yes. It will be interesting to see whether the US have actively assisted the Anglo-Saxons or not. I suspect we may not have a clear answer to that from the Americans. It is something that we need to handle. Tom's Rostocks, playing the part of Russia's military chief, offers a view. This was probably implied when the state secretary said that the US would pursue an even-handed approach. It is fair to assume that, yes. The admiral suggests asking the Americans to help them sink the British submarine that fired the missile if they really are being even-handed. We can always ask. That is an excellent question. In London, the Prime Minister also wants to speak to the Americans, as the President had warned in his social media post that whoever seeks war will regret it. And if you remember, his last word on his tweet is, I think they will pay. Wasn't that the line on his tweet? It was, yes. It was. So, I think we need to go straight back to the United States and remind them that the Russians have, in a sense, done that. He's referring to the fact the British submarine had been acting in self-defence.",

While you are prepping and doing that, the Foreign Secretary can get us on the line to the US Secretary of State. He's apparently ready to speak to us again. I really think you need to go and do that now and have a quick glance at your speech. The National Security Advisor is preparing his boss for what will be the most significant public broadcast by any British Prime Minister since the Second World War. Am I actually going to do it? Ben Wallace leaves the room with his press secretary. They head down the corridor and into a small radio studio. Take a seat just there. Right, okay. His team has already worked up a draft speech, but ultimately it's up to the Prime Minister to decide what to say. He makes his own handwritten changes. Russian missiles have impacted our brave emergency services. I've deployed to the scenes. We are appealing for those of you in the areas affected by the missile attacks to remain in place and to listen to news. It's important that you will be safe and easy to look after if you remain at home. So stay at home. That's the first thing you do. Stay at home. Hide them on the table basically. Stay at home. Further advice will be It's now just gone six in the morning on Monday the 6th of October 2025. Good morning. In the early hours of this morning, this country came under armed attack by Russia. This attack was unprovoked, illegal under international law, and utterly unnecessary. So, Foreign Secretary, can I suggest you take the PM's chair just for now?
