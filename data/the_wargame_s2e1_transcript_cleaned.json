      "content": "Reginald Johnson had been a Shakespearean actor before the Second World War broke out. Like most of his generation, he put his own dreams on hold to serve the nation in its time of crisis. His grandson, though, has dedicated his whole life to defence as a soldier, a scholar and a senior civil servant. Rob is fiercely loyal to his country and would never want to talk it down, but he's become increasingly worried about the state of the UK's defences after a prolonged period of peace that's seen the government and society forget what it means to be ready for war. It's a concern he raised while seconded to the Ministry of Defence. My job was to try to alert colleagues to what was going on and where the gaps were. What I found, actually, was that many, many people agreed with me. They knew we were in the position we are. But the response often was, look, government's about choice, and the government of the day and the governments we've had have all made the same choice, which is that we're going to invest in health and education and roads and growth, not in defence. Resilience was second nature during the Cold War, but when the Soviet Union collapsed, successive prime ministers spent less on the armed forces and more on other priorities. European allies did the same, all seeing this as a peace dividend, while gambling that the United States would still protect them if things went wrong. But the threat posed by Russia never really went away. And now, under Donald Trump, America's support to its partners in NATO no longer feels so guaranteed. I think it's common sense, right? If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them. I got into a lot of heat when I said that. You said, oh, he's violating NATO. With Europe weak and Russia on a war footing, it's a perfect storm. I'm Debra Haines, the security and defence editor at Sky News. I've been a journalist for the past two and a half decades and can tell you that Rob isn't alone with his concerns. Pretty much everyone I speak to inside the military says the UK has allowed its defences to shrink too far and has lost the kind of national resilience it once had during the Cold War. But because we live in a country that generally feels pretty safe, it's perhaps hard to understand why or even whether that matters. It made me wonder, what if we simulate an emergency and find out how the UK might respond? Whatever the outcome, it would at least bring to life the reality of the threat.",

I asked him if he might be up for running a war game about an attack on the UK, with former ministers and military chiefs playing the part of the British side. He thought it was worth a try. It's why we're sitting together in this basement. So we chose a bunker, we've created some maps. Rob's just finalising the game he's devised over the past few months. So we've got a lot of mechanics we've had to put together behind the game. It's taken a long time. So I did a bit of research. He describes the scenario as extremely low likelihood, but high impact. That means a low chance of it happening, but catastrophic consequences if it did. And as he works, on a desk in front of him is his grandfather's watch. It's pretty dramatic because you can hear the ticking of this clock and it feels like, both in the game but also for real, that our time is running out. What you're about to hear is the kind of war game that's genuinely tested inside government. The main difference is that nothing discussed in Rob's version is classified. Russia knows our weaknesses.

      "content": "First of all, thank you very much indeed all of you for the hours you're giving out, the time. Rob is welcoming his players into the basement. It's been transformed into the set of the War Game, with three rooms connected by a winding corridor. Each one has a table, some chairs and a network of microphones to record every conversation. Thank you as well. I've got my Pembroke College students at the back from Oxford. Thanks so much for coming. They helped with all the rehearsals. As the Games Master, he heads what's known as the White Cell, which runs the event. A lovely crew of individuals at the back here. Rob has a team of helpers who'll give the various participants certain slips of paper containing new information at different times throughout the game. These, in Wargame language, are known as Injects. Now let me bring in the players. War games typically have a blue team and a red team. In our scenario, blue is an imagined British government, while red is a fictional Kremlin. We chose our cast carefully, ensuring a mix of Labour and Conservative ministers and top officials who either played the roles they've been given for real or have deep expertise in different but relevant jobs. I'm Ben Wallis, former Secretary of State to Feds, and I'm going to be playing the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Why did you want to take part in this? Because I think it's really important that we demonstrate to the public how government makes decisions in real crisis and emergencies. And it's at that moment in time that no matter what people's party politics are, people pull together for the right reasons. In the war game, Ben heads a cross-party government at a time of heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin's Russia. I think what's amazing about this, the team you put together, Debs, is we're all the real deal. I mean, I'm not the prime minister, but we've all been there and I think that's quite unique, to be honest. I'll let him and his team introduce themselves. After myself as Prime Minister, which is an interesting choice, I'm going to look forward to it. I've got Jack Straw. Jack Straw, Home Secretary between 1997 and 2001, Foreign Secretary between 2001 and 2006, and Justice Secretary between 2007 and 2010. He's very experienced. And I'm playing the role of Foreign Secretary. I've got Amber Rudd, my former boss when I was security minister in the Home Office. Amber Rudd, former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change 2015-16 and then Home Secretary 2016-18. She is going to be doing the part of the Home Secretary. And then I've got my former colleague James Heape. James Heapie, I was Minister for the Armed Forces from 2019 to 2024 and I'm playing the Defence Secretary. He's one of the most experienced parliamentarians who had done tours in Northern Ireland, in Iraq and Afghanistan as a soldier in some very difficult times. I've got Baroness Kennedy as our Attorney General. Helena Kennedy, I'm a member of the House of Lords, I'm a practitioner barrister King's Council of lengthy experience and I now practice in international law, international humanitarian law and the laws of war. And then another colleague I work with, Lord Sedwell. Mark Sedwell, National Security Advisor 2017-20, Cabinet Secretary 2018-20, former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office. Former Ambassador in Afghanistan and National Security Advisor. And National Security Advisor in the exercise. My chief of defence staff is General Barons. General Sir Richard Barons, I commanded Joint Forces Command 2013 to 2016, and I've just finished being one of the leaders of the 2025 Defence Review. Just hot on the heels of delivering Labour's current strategic defence review. He's an innovative and forward-thinking general, so that is going to be really great. We also have a chancellor, who you'll meet in episode two. And the scenario is they're flying in from Beijing The Treasury are playing their role perfectly, as ever It's not a joke, they often wouldn't attend meetings It's very normal for the Treasury to miss Cobra Finally, the Prime Minister has a press secretary who's played by Victoria McInnes Victoria McInnes, I'm a communications specialist She's a former civil servant and an expert on communications who works in the defence industry Ben Wallace and his government are being supported by a group of expert advisors who you'll hear more from later. We'll also meet the Russia team once the game is underway.",

      "content": "Governments around the world use war games to run through scenarios and test responses for literally anything from health emergencies to World War III. Typically, they're conducted in secret, with the blue and the red teams pitched against each other, each able to act as they choose. In our scenario, though, the red team, while free to make some choices, is already aware of the key steps it will take. By contrast, the blue team knows very little about the scenario and will have to respond to whatever comes its way. As well as running the show, Rob is playing the role of what's known as the Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, or JIC Chair. He'll share updates from the UK's spy agencies, MI6, MI5 and GCHQ, as well as Defence Intelligence, which is part of the Ministry of Defence, or MOD. There are lots of acronyms in the military and the security world. I'll try to spell them out whenever they come up. With the drama about to start... ...Ben and his team have assembled around a long table... ...in the largest of the basement rooms We're now going to open the exercise In the real world, it's a Tuesday morning in early April. In the war game, it's almost six months in the future, and the government is in crisis mode. To set the scene, we've mocked up some rolling news reports from an imagined UK television station. Everyone stops talking and listens. It's 8am on Monday 29th September, our top story this morning. Travel chaos on the railways and the roads after a major power cut left parts of England and Wales without electricity. Multiple train stations have been forced to close to passengers this morning after what the National Grid is describing as an issue with two generators. Reports are also coming in of problems on the roads. Transport for London says some traffic lights in the capital are out of action and police officers may be called in to manage certain junctions. The disruption comes just three days after simultaneous fires broke out at ferry terminals in Plymouth and Portsmouth, halting Channel Ferry crossings over the weekend. The Home Office says counter-terrorism officers are now investigating the fires as a precautionary measure. The security sources say they haven't ruled out foul play. Last year, the heads of MI6 and the CIA accused Moscow of waging a reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe. Russia has previously denied involvement in any sabotage attacks. And there could, of course, be a perfectly innocent explanation for this transport chaos. For now, the cause is unclear. Then, two days later, this happens. It's 8am on Wednesday, the 1st of October. Our top story. Explosions have ripped through a major naval base in northern Russia, killing and wounding dozens of personnel. The Russian president has suggested the attack at Severomorsk was linked to the UK and has vowed revenge. The British government has yet to comment, but Downing Street sources have strongly rejected the allegation of any UK involvement. We'll bring you more as we get it. As tensions grow between Moscow and London over the next few days, British police make a shocking discovery. It's 4pm on Sunday 5th October, our top story. The Ministry of Defence says two F-35 pilots have been found shot dead in Norfolk. The circumstances of the deaths are not clear and military police are investigating. Both pilots are part of 617 Squadron, which fly the UK's most sophisticated F-35 warplanes out of RAF Marham. In other news, Moscow has recalled its ambassador to London, saying Britain is now considered an unfriendly state. The extraordinary move follows the deadly blasts at a major Russian naval base that the Kremlin has claimed were linked to the UK, but without providing evidence.",

So, thank you colleagues for attending on Sunday afternoon. Could I ask the National Security Advisor, Marc San Martin, to follow us through the agenda Prime Minister, thanks. I suggest we start just by seeing whether there's anything further in terms of threat or other intelligence that we need to know before we come to the various options for action both by you and colleagues. Rob gives his first inject of information to the players. I'll start with the situation update of where we are. There was indeed on the 1st of October a terrorist attack in northern Russia. It does appear that in the early hours of that day, over 100 Russian labour personnel were killed in detonations around the port of Murmansk Severomorsk and its residential area. GCHQ did a lot of work to try and identify who had been behind this particular attack. Rather curiously, there were some inferences that darker styles are involved The intelligence is referring to Islamist extremists from the Russian Republic of Dagestan. It suggests their motivation for launching the attack could be anger at Moscow for recruiting their men to fight in Ukraine. The Russian government announced that they needed little further evidence to confirm that this was an attack by British intelligence using divers. I think we can dismiss this nonsense. Rob then shares information from MI5 on the two F-35 pilots whose bodies were found early in the morning. Both appear to have died on Saturday night. Police investigations are ongoing. We have low confidence in the intelligence so far, but it's likely that these men were tracked before they were killed. He highlights two other important developments. Signals intelligence reveals that there is a snap Russian naval exercise underway today involving rehearsals for the deployment of surface-to-surface missiles in the North Atlantic. What they also note at Cheltenham is the intensity of cyber attacks on UK businesses and government websites has increased by a magnitude of 65%. Cheltenham refers to the location of GCHQ, the government's signals and cyber intelligence agency. While the cause of the rise in cyber attacks isn't clear, it could be yet another sign of hostile Russian activity. The National Security Advisor is interested in what appears to be an exceptionally large Russian naval exercise involving warships, aircraft and submarines. It's being tracked by American, Norwegian and British ships. When he says CDS, he means Chief of the Defence Staff. That's the Prime Minister's top military advisor and head of the UK Armed Forces. PM perhaps from CDS, just more on this Russian naval exercise and how we're monitoring it, and in particular CDS, do you have any concerns about how they're operating in these circumstances? Yes, thank you. So, Prime Minister, if I may, from the military perspective, I'd like to widen this discussion a little bit.",

And then dining in remotely, we have Robin Hagblom. He is a naval analyst from Finland and he will be playing the commander of Russia's Northern Fleet. The Navy is very eager to take this opportunity to be able to extract revenge for the terrorist attack at Cevermosh. Appearing via video link, his backdrop shows the inside of a warship. He's got a good backdrop. Robin looks very operational. In reality, he's in his office in Finland. Robin is a senior advisor at a risk assessment company called Risk Intelligence. And despite what he said about extracting revenge, no one on the Russian team really believes the UK had anything to do with the explosions at their naval base. It is our assessment that it was the terrorist attack carried out by the Pakistani extremists. The Chief of the General Staff has just been asked who was responsible.

The word means fog in Russian. The president asks his spy chief whether she thinks the US will help the UK. It is the assessment of my agency that the US have no interest in engaging in war fighting in Europe. Britain and the US have drifted apart increasingly during the past years. US resources remain focused in the Indo-Pacific. This is a bold and necessary operation that will effectively be the end of NATO. The commander of the Northern Fleet gives an update on the readiness of his flotilla. As we have been able to prepare for these strikes for two months, we are in a relatively good shape, though of course we have not been able to create any miracles or add new units to the fleet in this time. So to confirm, Admiral, we are not expecting that the United Kingdom is able to defend realistically against our missiles, is that correct? That is correct. The number of air defenses they have available able to intercept our missiles is very limited. We have a significant number of missiles aboard our ships and submarines. This should not be an issue.

The defence chief lists the tasks, from defending the UK airspace to tracking the Russian flotilla, despite far too few jets, ships and missiles. Everybody knows we can't do it all. He also says there's a big question mark over whether NATO is going to help. Thank you, CDS. We can definitely get on with the planning necessary to provide the protection and oversight and surveillance requirements that you've described. But right at the back of my mind is that we are beginning to see the mortgaging of risk from political intent to operational reality. And the operational reality is that we are extremely thin on the ground and will require quite a lot of negotiation with NATO, who will also be feeling the same pressure to do something nationally as opposed to collectively. So in the spirit of the Cobra meeting, it was not the time for us to have a protracted discussion about how we're dealing with a major Russian military threat with armed forces that have been conditioned by 30 years of traveling through the post-Cold War era. And we are where we are, with what we have. And as you describe, unless NATO stands up and supports us now, we're going to feel pretty chilly pretty soon.",
