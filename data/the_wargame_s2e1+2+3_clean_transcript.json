Reports are also coming in of problems on the roads. Transport for London says some traffic lights in the capital are out of action and police officers may be called in to manage certain junctions. The disruption comes just three days after simultaneous fires broke out at ferry terminals in Plymouth and Portsmouth, halting Channel Ferry crossings over the weekend. The Home Office says counter-terrorism officers are now investigating the fires as a precautionary measure. The security sources say they haven't ruled out foul play.

Today, only a handful of RAF squadrons and a limited number of army systems can intercept cruise missiles. These are self-guided weapons propelled by a jet engine that are powered all the way onto a target. As for ballistic missiles, which are blasted to a high altitude, even out of the Earth's atmosphere, before dropping at a steep angle onto a target at great speed, the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyers are the UK's sole line of defence. But it only has six of these billion-pound warships, and four are routinely unavailable because of maintenance woes and crew shortages. One of them, HMS Daring, has spent more years being fixed than out at sea. A NATO command base in Germany is responsible for defending the airspace of the whole Alliance, including the UK. However, British forces would be the first line of defence against any threats coming straight at them from the Atlantic."
