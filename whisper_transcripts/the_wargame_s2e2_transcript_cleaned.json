Ben Wallace turned down the chance of running for prime minister in real life, but he was the longest serving conservative defence secretary, and before that, security minister.

When governments do this kind of exercise for real, Keir and his colleagues are among the people called upon to play the red team. As for Rob Johnson, the Oxford academic who devised the Wargame, he's busy getting ready for what's known as the next turn.

CDS, these four ballistic missiles inbound, which are presumably now going to hit Portsmouth imminently, do we have any sense whether those are conventional ballistic missiles or whether they potentially have a nuclear warhead on them? Richard Barons, our chief of the defence staff, or CDS, responds. You can't tell whether a ballistic missile is conventional or nuclear until it arrives and goes bang, and then you do know. Exactly, so we don't have any indication of what that is from intelligence or anything else, no. Our assessment is that it's highly unlikely, since we would have known about, I think, previous deployments of nuclear systems, but at this stage we can't take anything for granted. Adding to a collective sense of helplessness, the defence chief explains it's not possible to intercept these missiles. We have almost no defence against ballistic missiles except that the Type 45 air defence has limited capability if it's in the right place. It was in the wrong place. It can only be in one place at once. As I mentioned in episode one, UK air defences are a major casualty of cost-saving cuts since the end of the Cold War. The Type 45 warship is the single piece of British kit that can shoot down ballistic missiles, which are generally larger, heavier and harder to stop than cruise missiles. We have in theory six, We probably have in reality four of which in reality two are at sea or able to be at sea. Certainly they are based in Portsmouth and therefore they do have a limited but capable ballistic missile defense, small as it is. Where is the current Type 45, Sid, yes?

HMS Queen Elizabeth is damaged and on fire. — Another map appears, showing where Russian crews and ballistic missiles hit targets at the Royal Navy's main base in Portsmouth. HMS Queen Elizabeth is a £3 billion aircraft carrier and national status symbol. James Heapey, as Defence Secretary, lists what's been impacted. Queen Elizabeth damaged on fire. Type 45 HMS Diamond is damaged. HMS Richmond, an anti-submarine warfare frigate, is crippled and one offshore patrol vessel has been sunk on its mooring. This is a devastating blow for the Navy. It's also a catastrophic moment for the whole nation. The Prime Minister must decide on a military response, with or without NATO. He's already asked for options to sink at least one of the Russian vessels or aircraft, but his defence chief wants to do more. So there are two things that seem to me as CDS clear. One is Russia has committed an act of war against the UK, and we're having the discussion about Article 5. The second is it is extremely unclear that the US is going to honor its obligations, which we have benefited from and trusted for 75 years, and it's beginning to feel pretty lonely. And therefore, in your conversation with the National Secretary General, Quite apart from what we need to do to protect the UK, I need you to consider two big options. The first is, below the nuclear threshold, the UK has national things we could do in cyberspace or by using the RAF F-35s to attack deep into Russia. Are you prepared to consider unilaterally taking the fight to Russia? He's suggesting offensive cyber attacks inside Russia. Another option is to deploy the military's F-35 warplanes to fly what would be a high-risk bombing raid. And secondly, we have to assume that Russia is going to attack again. And the first wave of attacks were on the military architecture. The second wave of attacks, to have any effect at all, are going to be on our daily national life. They're going to be on our critical national infrastructure and the continuity of government. Surely, we're approaching the point where Russia needs to understand that if it does that, We are at the point of using our strategic nuclear weapon, or at least considering it.

The CDS has some options, but we are outmatched by the Russians conventionally. If the Secretary-General wants to avoid this ending up in a strategic nuclear exchange, then we need conventional options from our allies in order to be able to deter the Russians from taking this further.

We know we are at a position of profound conventional disadvantage and what we're all shying away from is being a situation where the only thing left in the locker is the strategic nuclear deterrent. The prime minister is very focused on this. As you know, one boat at sea, the second boat will put to sea. It won't be as ready as you and I would like, but it'll have some capability. What happens if this becomes a protracted campaign? Well, unless our allies choose to fight for us, we'll find this extraordinarily difficult. And I'm using understatement there. But unless our allies give us their material, we're out of the game in a week. So I'm struggling to find easy or attractive outcomes to this.
