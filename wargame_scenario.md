ALL THE INFORMATION IN THIS APP IS BASED ON A FICTIONAL WARGAME.

Scenario Overview

The Wargame is a groundbreaking podcast series by Sky News and Tortoise Media that places real-world British figures—former Cabinet Ministers, intelligence officials, and military chiefs—into a simulated, high-stakes national crisis. Series 2 of the podcast simulates a scenario where the UK is attacked by Russia, rapidly escalating into a full-scale war. The players, forming an emergency Cabinet known as COBRA, must make critical, agonizing decisions under immense pressure, dealing with cyber attacks, missile strikes, diplomatic failures, and the specter of nuclear war. This simulation exposes the critical vulnerabilities in UK national resilience and strategy, forcing players to confront trade-offs between military response, civilian safety, and alliance cohesion.

The AI Decision Support MVP

This application is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to demonstrate how artificial intelligence agents could support human decision-makers during a fast-moving, high-stress crisis like the Wargame.

The AI Agents provide concise, role-specific strategic advice and analysis of raw data (the transcripts) in real-time. This is solely a demonstration project. A real-world system supporting government or military operations would require:

Careful Design: Integrating human-AI teams effectively.

Explainable AI (XAI): Ensuring the rationale behind every piece of advice is clear.

Rigorous Assurance: Extensive testing and verification of AI outputs and constraints.

The goal is to move the human player from processing raw data to making informed, strategic choices.
